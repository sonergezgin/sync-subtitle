00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,361
I was sitting with my friend
Arthur Kornblum in a restaurant.

3
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,698
It was a Horn & Hardart cafeteria.

4
00:02:21,832 --> 00:02:26,374
And this beautiful girl walked in,
and I turned to Arthur

5
00:02:26,502 --> 00:02:31,578
and I said "Arthur, you see that girl?
I'm going to marry her."

6
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:34,335
And two weeks later
we were married.

7
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:37,799
And it's over 50 years later,

8
00:02:37,928 --> 00:02:40,169
and we're still married.

9
00:02:54,566 --> 00:02:56,605
- I love you.
- I love you.

10
00:03:31,137 --> 00:03:34,221
Oh, hi, Sally.
Sally, this is Harry Burns.

11
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:37,716
- Harry, this is Sally Albright.
- Nice to meet you.

12
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:41,301
- Wanna drive the first shift?
- No, you're there already. You can start.

13
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:43,678
Back's open.

14
00:03:44,606 --> 00:03:47,275
- Call me.
- I'll call you as soon as I get there.

15
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,479
- Call me from the road.
- I'll call you before that.

16
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:54,731
- I love you.
- I love you.

17
00:03:59,076 --> 00:04:00,567
Sorry.

18
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:02,933
- I miss you already.
- I miss you.

19
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:05,999
- I miss you already. Bye.
- Bye.

20
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,966
I have it all figured out.
It's an 18-hour trip,

21
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,420
which breaks down into
six shifts of three hours each,

22
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,522
or, alternatively,
we could break it down by mileage.

23
00:04:32,186 --> 00:04:35,886
There's a...
There's a map on the visor

24
00:04:36,022 --> 00:04:39,936
that I've... marked to show
the locations where we can change shifts.

25
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:41,627
Grape?

26
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:44,535
No. I don't like to eat
between meals.

27
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:51,440
I'll roll down the window.

28
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,084
Why don't you tell me
the story of your life?

29
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:05,213
The story of my life?

30
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:07,623
We got 18 hours to kill
before we hit New York.

31
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:10,733
The story of my life doesn't
even get us out of Chicago.

32
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:12,528
I mean, nothing's
happened to me yet.

33
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,849
- That's why I'm going to New York.
- So something'll happen to you?

34
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:16,232
- Yes.
- Like what?

35
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:19,129
Like I'm going to journalism school
to become a reporter.

36
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:21,862
So you can write about things
that happen to other people.

37
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,223
- That's one way to look at it.
- Suppose nothing happens to you.

38
00:05:26,396 --> 00:05:28,388
Suppose you live there your whole life
and nothing happens,

39
00:05:28,388 --> 00:05:30,385
you never meet anybody,
you never become anything,

40
00:05:30,385 --> 00:05:32,356
then you finally die
one of those New York deaths

41
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:35,843
when nobody notices for two weeks
until the smell drifts into the hallway.

42
00:05:38,447 --> 00:05:41,613
- Amanda mentioned you had a dark side.
- That's what drew her to me.

43
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:45,121
- Your dark side?
- Sure. Why, don't you have a dark side?

44
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:47,313
I know, you're probably
one of those cheerful people

45
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,129
who dots your "i"s
with little hearts.

46
00:05:49,164 --> 00:05:51,708
I have just as much of
a dark side as the next person.

47
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:55,367
Oh, really? When I buy a new book,
I always read the last page first.

48
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:58,289
That way, in case I die before I finish,
I know how it ends.

49
00:05:58,421 --> 00:06:00,829
That, my friend,
is a dark side.

50
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:02,580
That doesn't mean
you're deep or anything.

51
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,775
I mean... yes, basically
I'm a happy person.

52
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:06,318
So am I.

53
00:06:06,318 --> 00:06:08,220
And I don't see that
there's anything wrong with that.

54
00:06:08,388 --> 00:06:10,043
Of course not, you're
too busy being happy.

55
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:11,748
Do you ever think
about death?

56
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:13,930
- Yes.
- Sure you do. A fleeting thought

57
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:15,731
that you're just sending out
of the transom of your mind.

58
00:06:15,731 --> 00:06:17,663
I spend hours, I spend days.

59
00:06:17,663 --> 00:06:19,753
And you think
this makes you a better person.

60
00:06:19,772 --> 00:06:22,740
Look, when the shit comes down,
I'm gonna be prepared and you're not.

61
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,692
That's all I'm sayin'.

62
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:26,711
In the meantime, you're gonna
ruin your whole life waiting for it.

63
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:36,530
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

64
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,593
- You're wrong.
- He wants her to leave.

65
00:06:38,593 --> 00:06:41,674
- That's why he puts her on the plane.
- I don't think she wants to stay.

66
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:43,154
Of course she wants to stay.

67
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:45,842
Wouldn't you rather be with
Humphrey Bogart than the other guy?

68
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:49,274
I don't wanna spend
the rest of my life in Casablanca

69
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:51,475
married to a man
who runs a bar.

70
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,836
That probably sounds
very snobbish to you, but I don't.

71
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:57,574
- You'd rather be in a passionless marriage...
- And be the First Lady of Czechoslovakia.

72
00:06:57,574 --> 00:07:00,546
And live with a man man you had
the greatest sex of your life with,

73
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,431
just because he owns a bar
and that is all he does?

74
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:04,967
Yes.

75
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,550
And so would any woman in
her right mind. Women are practical,

76
00:07:08,686 --> 00:07:13,647
even Ingrid Bergman, which is why she
gets on the plane at the end of the movie.

77
00:07:16,526 --> 00:07:18,684
I understand.

78
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:21,274
- What? What?
- Nothing.

79
00:07:21,822 --> 00:07:23,778
- What?
- Forget about it.

80
00:07:23,907 --> 00:07:26,362
- Forget about what? Forget about what?
- It's not important.

81
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:28,531
No, just tell me.

82
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:32,082
Obviously, you haven't had
great sex yet.

83
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:34,363
- Two, please.
- Right over there.

84
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:36,621
- Yes, I have.
- No, you haven't.

85
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,450
It just so happens that
I have had plenty of good sex.

86
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:00,618
With whom?

87
00:08:01,228 --> 00:08:04,892
- What?
- With whom did you have this great sex?

88
00:08:05,106 --> 00:08:07,145
I'm not gonna tell you that.

89
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:09,269
Fine. Don't tell me.

90
00:08:14,614 --> 00:08:18,397
- Shel Gordon.
- Shel. Sheldon?

91
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:21,866
No. No, you did not have
great sex with... Sheldon.

92
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:24,416
- I did, too.
- No, you didn't.

93
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,954
A Sheldon can do
your income taxes.

94
00:08:26,954 --> 00:08:29,429
If you need a root canal,
Sheldon's your man.

95
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:32,583
But humpin' and pumpin' is not
Sheldon's strong suit. It's the name.

96
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,278
"Do it to me, Sheldon."
"You're an animal... Sheldon."

97
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:37,833
"Ride me, big... Sheldon."

98
00:08:37,868 --> 00:08:40,232
- It doesn't work.
- Hi.

99
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:43,090
- What can I get you?
- I'll have a number three.

100
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:46,961
I'd like the chef's salad, please, with
the oil and vinegar on the side.

101
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:48,428
And the apple pie a la mode.

102
00:08:48,558 --> 00:08:51,843
Chef and apple a la mode.

103
00:08:51,977 --> 00:08:54,898
But I'd like the pie heated
and I don't want the ice cream on top,

104
00:08:54,898 --> 00:08:55,868
I want it on the side.

105
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,061
And I'd like strawberry
instead of vanilla, if you have it.

106
00:08:58,061 --> 00:09:00,876
If not, then no ice cream,
just whipped cream, but only if it's real.

107
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:02,248
If it's out of a can, then nothing.

108
00:09:02,444 --> 00:09:06,529
- Not even the pie?
- No, just the pie, but then not heated.

109
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,069
Uh-huh.

110
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,766
- What?
- Nothin'. Nothin'.

111
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,866
So, how come
you broke up with Sheldon?

112
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:21,490
How do you know
we broke up?

113
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,623
Because, if you didn't break up,
you wouldn't be here with me.

114
00:09:23,623 --> 00:09:26,006
You'd be off with Sheldon
the Wonder Schlong.

115
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,248
First of all,
I am not with you.

116
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:33,965
And second of all, it is none
of your business why we broke up.

117
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:37,255
You're right, you're right.
I don't wanna know.

118
00:09:40,224 --> 00:09:43,078
Well, if you must know,
it was because he was very jealous

119
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:45,176
and I had these
days-of-the-week underpants.

120
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,219
I'm sorry, I need
a judge's ruling on this.

121
00:09:48,263 --> 00:09:50,893
- Days-of-the-week underpants?
- Yes.

122
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:54,309
They had days of the week on them
and I thought they were sort of funny.

123
00:09:54,444 --> 00:09:58,061
And then one day Sheldon says to me
"You never wear Sunday."

124
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:01,232
He's all suspicious. Where was Sunday?
Where had I left Sunday?

125
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:03,524
And I told him
and he didn't believe me.

126
00:10:03,993 --> 00:10:06,910
- What?
- They don't make Sunday.

127
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:10,405
- Why not?
- Because of God.

128
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:18,956
Okay, so 15%
of my share is... 90.

129
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:21,099
6.90.

130
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:26,938
Let's leave seven.

131
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:31,856
What?

132
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,330
Do I have
something on my face?

133
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,725
You're a very attractive person.

134
00:10:40,897 --> 00:10:42,095
Thank you.

135
00:10:42,232 --> 00:10:44,438
Amanda never said
how attractive you were.

136
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:47,252
Well, maybe she doesn't think
I'm attractive.

137
00:10:47,361 --> 00:10:51,344
I don't think it's a matter of opinion.
Empirically, you are attractive.

138
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:55,530
Amanda is my friend.

139
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:57,118
So?

140
00:10:57,244 --> 00:11:00,078
- So you're going with her.
- So?

141
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:02,363
So you're coming on to me.

142
00:11:02,957 --> 00:11:04,813
No, I wasn't.

143
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,217
What?

144
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:11,981
Can't a man say a woman is attractive
without it being a come-on?

145
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,570
All right, all right.

146
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:18,418
Let's just say, just for the sake
of argument, that it was a come-on.

147
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:22,550
What d'you want me to do about it?
I take it back, okay? I take it back.

148
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,139
You can't take it back.

149
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,934
- Why not?
- Because it's already out there.

150
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:30,510
Oh, geez, what are we supposed to do?
Call the cops, it's already out there.

151
00:11:30,812 --> 00:11:33,682
Just let it lie.

152
00:11:33,815 --> 00:11:38,559
- Okay?
- Great. "Let it lie." That's my policy.

153
00:11:38,694 --> 00:11:41,777
That's what
I always say. "Let it lie."

154
00:11:41,905 --> 00:11:43,648
Wanna spend the night
in a motel?

155
00:11:43,781 --> 00:11:45,820
- See what I did? I didn't let it lie.
- Harry.

156
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,147
I said I would,
and I didn't.

157
00:11:47,147 --> 00:11:48,330
- Harry!
- I walked the other way.

158
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,742
- Harry.
- What?

159
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:52,276
We are just
going to be friends, okay?

160
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:54,888
Great. Friends.
It's the best thing.

161
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,286
You realize of course
that we could never be friends.

162
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:02,170
- Why not?
- What I'm saying is,

163
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:05,255
and this is not a come-on
in any way, shape or form,

164
00:12:05,382 --> 00:12:07,145
is that men and women
can't be friends,

165
00:12:07,145 --> 00:12:09,687
because the sex part
always gets in the way.

166
00:12:11,804 --> 00:12:14,973
That's not true. I have
a number of men friends

167
00:12:14,973 --> 00:12:16,513
and there is
no sex involved.

168
00:12:16,513 --> 00:12:17,380
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

169
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:18,714
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

170
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:20,096
You only think you do.

171
00:12:20,227 --> 00:12:22,468
You're saying I'm having sex
with these men without my knowledge?

172
00:12:22,604 --> 00:12:25,527
No, what I'm saying is
they all wanna have sex with you.

173
00:12:26,065 --> 00:12:27,642
- They do not.
- Do, too.

174
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:29,767
- They do not.
- Do, too.

175
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:30,897
How do you know?

176
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:34,146
Because no man can be friends
with a woman that he finds attractive.

177
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,593
He always wants
to have sex with her.

178
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:41,243
So, you're saying that a man can be friends
with a woman he finds unattractive.

179
00:12:41,536 --> 00:12:44,043
No, you pretty much
wanna nail them, too.

180
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:48,157
What if they don't
wanna have sex with you?

181
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,959
Doesn't matter. Because the sex thing
is already out there,

182
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,144
so the friendship is ultimately doomed
and that is the end of the story.

183
00:12:54,713 --> 00:12:56,505
Well, I guess we're not
gonna be friends then.

184
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:58,745
- Guess not.
- That's too bad.

185
00:12:59,675 --> 00:13:02,574
You were the only person
that I knew in New York.

186
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:44,590
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah. It was interesting.

187
00:13:45,295 --> 00:13:48,033
- It was nice knowing you.
- Yeah.

188
00:13:57,388 --> 00:14:01,219
- Well, have a nice life.
- You, too.

189
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:22,902
- We fell in love in high school.
- Yeah, we were high-school sweethearts.

190
00:14:23,034 --> 00:14:26,283
But then after our junior year
his parents moved away.

191
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:30,539
- But I never forgot her.
- He never forgot me.

192
00:14:30,665 --> 00:14:34,033
No, her face
was burned on my brain.

193
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:37,785
And it was 34 years later
that I was walking down Broadway

194
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,043
and I saw her
come out of Toffenetti's.

195
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:42,046
We both looked
at each other,

196
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:46,550
and it was just as though
not a single day had gone by.

197
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:50,674
She was just as beautiful
as she was at sixteen.

198
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,047
He was just the same.

199
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,424
He looked
exactly the same.

200
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:30,789
Joe. I thought it was you.
I thought it was you.

201
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:32,960
- Harry Burns.
- Harry, Harry. How ya doin'?

202
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,915
- Good. How you doin'?
- Uh, fine. I'm doin' fine.

203
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:38,278
That's great. I was just walking by
and I thought it was you.

204
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:40,221
- And there it is, it was you.
- Yeah, yeah, it was.

205
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:41,749
You still with the DA's office?

206
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:44,970
No, I switched to the other side.
W-what about you?

207
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,757
I work with a small firm.
We do political consulting. Yeah, it's great.

208
00:15:50,777 --> 00:15:53,762
Oh, Harry, this is Sally Albright.
Harry Burns. Uh...

209
00:15:54,148 --> 00:15:57,102
Harry and I, we used to, uh...
We lived in the same building.

210
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:03,331
Well, listen, I got a plane to catch.
It was really good to see you, Joe.

211
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:05,186
- You too, Harry.
- Bye.

212
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,146
Thank God
he couldn't place me.

213
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:15,485
I drove from college to New York
with him five years ago

214
00:16:15,485 --> 00:16:18,344
and it was
the longest night of my life.

215
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:22,961
- What happened?
- He made a pass at me. And when I said no,

216
00:16:23,088 --> 00:16:25,689
he was going
with a girlfriend of mine, uh...

217
00:16:27,091 --> 00:16:30,175
Oh, God,
I can't remember her name.

218
00:16:30,302 --> 00:16:31,742
Don't get involved
with me, Joe.

219
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:34,592
I am 26 years old and I can't
even remember the name of the girl

220
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:35,693
I was such good friends with

221
00:16:35,693 --> 00:16:37,799
I wouldn't get involved
with her boyfriend.

222
00:16:38,392 --> 00:16:40,431
- So what happened?
- When?

223
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,734
When-when he made
a pass at you, you said no...

224
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:46,493
Oh, oh. I said
we could just be friends.

225
00:16:46,648 --> 00:16:47,753
And this part I remember.

226
00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:51,218
He said that men and women
could never really be friends.

227
00:16:52,573 --> 00:16:54,401
Do you think that's true?

228
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:56,478
No.

229
00:16:56,767 --> 00:17:01,245
Do you have any women friends,
just friends?

230
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,611
No.

231
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:04,822
But I will get one
if it's important to you.

232
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:11,209
Amanda Reese.
That was her name. Thank God.

233
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:14,911
I will miss you.
I love you.

234
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:19,336
- You do?
- Yes.

235
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:22,232
I love you.

236
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:48,317
- And what would you like to drink?
- Nothing, thanks.

237
00:17:48,506 --> 00:17:50,440
- D'you have any Bloody Mary mix?
- Yes.

238
00:17:50,575 --> 00:17:54,715
No, wait. Here's what I want.
Regular tomato juice,

239
00:17:54,715 --> 00:17:55,916
fill it up
about three quarters,

240
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,591
then add a splash of
Bloody Mary mix - just a splash -

241
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:00,802
and a little piece of lime
on the side.

242
00:18:00,837 --> 00:18:02,815
The University of Chicago,
right?

243
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,208
Yes.

244
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,726
Did you look this good
at the University of Chicago?

245
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:09,952
- No.
- Did we ever...?

246
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:12,380
No. No.

247
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:17,220
We drove from Chicago to New York
together after graduation.

248
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,507
- Would you two like to sit together?
- Great! Thank you.

249
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:29,097
You were a good friend of, um...

250
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,640
Amanda's. I can't believe
you can't remember her name.

251
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:36,266
What do you mean? I can remember.
Amanda, right? Amanda Rice.

252
00:18:36,403 --> 00:18:36,977
Reese.

253
00:18:36,977 --> 00:18:39,556
Reese, right. That's what I said.
Whatever happened to her?

254
00:18:39,556 --> 00:18:41,895
- I have no idea.
- You have no idea?

255
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:43,610
You were really
good friends with her.

256
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,930
We didn't make it
because you were such good friends.

257
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:47,985
- You went with her.
- And was it worth it?

258
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:50,319
The sacrifice for a friend that
you don't even keep in touch with?

259
00:18:50,456 --> 00:18:52,744
Harry, you might
not believe this,

260
00:18:52,874 --> 00:18:56,788
but I never considered
not sleeping with you a sacrifice.

261
00:18:57,044 --> 00:18:59,879
Fair enough. Fair enough.

262
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:05,249
- You were gonna be a gymnast.
- A journalist.

263
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:09,391
- Right, that's what I said. And?
- I am a journalist. I work at The News.

264
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:11,632
Great. And you're with Joe.

265
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:14,432
Well, that's great. Great.

266
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:17,173
You're together, what,
three weeks?

267
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:21,478
- A month. How did you know that?
- You take someone to the airport,

268
00:19:21,606 --> 00:19:23,513
it's clearly the beginning
of a relationship.

269
00:19:23,513 --> 00:19:25,640
That's why I have never
taken anyone to the airport

270
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,671
at the beginning
of a relationship.

271
00:19:27,706 --> 00:19:30,190
- Why?
- Because eventually things move on

272
00:19:30,321 --> 00:19:31,837
and you don't take
someone to the airport.

273
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,627
And I never wanted anyone
to say to me:

274
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:36,225
"How come you never take me
to the airport any more?"

275
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:40,114
It's amazing.
You look like a normal person,

276
00:19:40,114 --> 00:19:42,480
but actually you are
the Angel of Death.

277
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,883
Are you gonna marry him?

278
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,503
We have only known
each other for a month

279
00:19:47,503 --> 00:19:50,824
and, besides, neither one of us
is looking into getting married right now.

280
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:53,318
- I'm getting married.
- You are?

281
00:19:54,757 --> 00:19:57,030
- You are?
- Yeah.

282
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:58,759
Who is she?

283
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:01,852
Helen Hillson. She's a lawyer.
She's keeping her name.

284
00:20:03,414 --> 00:20:05,636
- You're getting married.
- Yeah.

285
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:09,595
What's so funny about that?

286
00:20:11,062 --> 00:20:14,062
It, uh... It's just
so optimistic of you, Harry.

287
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,106
Well, you'd be amazed what
falling madly in love can do for you.

288
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:20,649
Well, it's wonderful. It's nice
to see you embracing life in this manner.

289
00:20:20,948 --> 00:20:23,067
Yeah. Plus, you know,
you just get to a certain point

290
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:25,040
where you get tired
of the whole thing.

291
00:20:25,195 --> 00:20:28,441
- What whole thing?
- The whole "life of a single guy" thing.

292
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:30,542
You meet someone,
you have the safe lunch,

293
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:33,224
you decide to like each other or not
to move on to dinner.

294
00:20:33,224 --> 00:20:35,662
You go dancing,
you do the white man's overbite,

295
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,735
you go back to her place,
you have sex,

296
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:41,070
and the minute you're finished
you know what goes through your mind?

297
00:20:41,105 --> 00:20:43,011
"How long do I have
to lie here and hold her

298
00:20:43,011 --> 00:20:44,667
before I can get up
and go home?"

299
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:46,815
"Is 30 seconds enough?"

300
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:49,759
That's what you're thinking?
Is that true?

301
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:52,315
Sure. All men think that.

302
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:55,631
How long do you like to be
held afterwards? All night, right?

303
00:20:56,128 --> 00:20:57,202
See, that's the problem.

304
00:20:57,202 --> 00:21:00,034
Somewhere between 30 seconds
and all night is your problem.

305
00:21:00,351 --> 00:21:02,807
- I don't have a problem.
- Yeah, you do.

306
00:21:17,907 --> 00:21:20,398
- Staying over?
- Yes.

307
00:21:20,534 --> 00:21:24,152
Would you like to have dinner?
Just friends.

308
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:26,905
I thought you didn't believe
men and women could be friends.

309
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,119
- When did I say that?
- On the ride to New York.

310
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,491
No, no, no, no,
I never said that.

311
00:21:32,127 --> 00:21:35,910
Yes, that's right.
They can't be friends.

312
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,136
Unless both of them are involved
with other people.

313
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:40,877
Then they can. This is
an amendment to the earlier rule.

314
00:21:40,877 --> 00:21:45,411
If two people are in relationships, the
pressure of possible involvement is lifted.

315
00:21:46,381 --> 00:21:48,401
That doesn't work either
because what happens then

316
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:50,035
is the person you're involved with
can't understand

317
00:21:50,035 --> 00:21:52,054
why you need to be friends with
the person you're just friends with,

318
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,331
like it means something
is missing from the relationship

319
00:21:54,331 --> 00:21:55,958
and you want to go outside
to get it.

320
00:21:55,993 --> 00:21:57,740
Then when you say "No, no, no, no,
it's not true,

321
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,275
nothing is missing
from our relationship",

322
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:02,386
the person you're involved with and
accuses you of being secretly attracted

323
00:22:02,386 --> 00:22:04,633
to the person you're just friends with,
which you probably are.

324
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:06,760
I mean, come on, who the hell
are we kidding? Let's face it.

325
00:22:06,795 --> 00:22:09,103
Which brings us back to the earlier rule
before the amendment, which is

326
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,991
men and women can't be friends.
So where's that leave us?

327
00:22:12,074 --> 00:22:13,380
- Harry.
- What?

328
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,526
- Goodbye.
- Okay.

329
00:22:24,606 --> 00:22:27,330
I'll just stop walking.
I'll let you go ahead.

330
00:22:31,513 --> 00:22:33,505
We were married
40 years ago.

331
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:37,334
We were married three years,
we got a divorce. Then I married Marjorie.

332
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:40,008
- But first you lived with Barbara.
- Right, Barbara.

333
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,677
But I didn't marry Barbara.
I married Marjorie.

334
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:46,011
- Then you got a divorce.
- Right. Then I married Katie.

335
00:22:46,144 --> 00:22:47,769
Another divorce.

336
00:22:47,896 --> 00:22:52,231
Then a couple of years later at
Eddie Collecio's funeral, I ran into her.

337
00:22:52,983 --> 00:22:55,687
I was with some girl
I don't even remember.

338
00:22:55,886 --> 00:22:58,570
- Roberta.
- Right. Roberta.

339
00:22:58,696 --> 00:23:01,103
But I couldn't
take my eyes off you.

340
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,525
I remember I snuck over
to her and I said...

341
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:07,778
- What did I say?
- You said "What are you doin' after?"

342
00:23:07,912 --> 00:23:12,489
Right. So I ditch Roberta, we go
for coffee, a month later we're married.

343
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:15,708
35 years today
after our first marriage.

344
00:23:19,254 --> 00:23:20,878
I went through his pockets,
okay?

345
00:23:20,878 --> 00:23:22,681
Marie, why did you go
through his pockets?

346
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:24,552
- You know what I found?
- No, what?

347
00:23:24,552 --> 00:23:26,173
They just bought
a dining-room table.

348
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:29,652
I mean, his wife just went out and spent
1,600 dollars on a dining-room table.

349
00:23:29,652 --> 00:23:32,222
- Where?
- The point isn't where, Alice.

350
00:23:32,348 --> 00:23:34,726
The point is he's never
gonna leave her.

351
00:23:34,726 --> 00:23:37,137
So, what else is new?
You've known this for two years.

352
00:23:37,476 --> 00:23:39,765
You're right. You're right,
I know you're right.

353
00:23:40,016 --> 00:23:41,458
Why can't you find
someone single?

354
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:44,023
When I was single,
I knew lots of nice single men.

355
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:46,818
There must be someone.
Sally found someone.

356
00:23:46,943 --> 00:23:49,231
Well, Sally got
the last good one.

357
00:23:49,449 --> 00:23:51,235
- Joe and I broke up.
- What?

358
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,941
- When?
- Monday.

359
00:23:53,073 --> 00:23:55,279
- You waited three days to tell us?
- Joe's available?

360
00:23:55,408 --> 00:23:58,479
For God's sake, Marie,
don't you have any feelings about this?

361
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,783
- She's obviously upset.
- I'm not that upset.

362
00:24:00,783 --> 00:24:02,916
We'd been growing apart
for quite a while.

363
00:24:02,951 --> 00:24:04,331
But you guys were a couple.

364
00:24:04,457 --> 00:24:08,240
You had someone to go places with.
You had a date on national holidays.

365
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:09,637
I said to myself

366
00:24:09,637 --> 00:24:12,353
"You deserve more than this.
You're 31 years old..."

367
00:24:12,388 --> 00:24:13,379
And the clock is ticking.

368
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:16,802
No, the clock doesn't really start
to tick until you're 36.

369
00:24:16,837 --> 00:24:19,209
God, you're
in such great shape.

370
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:23,215
Well, I've had a few days
to get used to it, and, uh... I feel okay.

371
00:24:23,425 --> 00:24:26,279
Good.
Then you're ready.

372
00:24:27,362 --> 00:24:30,225
- Really, Marie.
- Well, how else do you think you do it?

373
00:24:30,353 --> 00:24:31,916
I've got the perfect guy.

374
00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:34,406
I don't happen to find him
attractive, but you might.

375
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:36,265
She doesn't have
a problem with chins.

376
00:24:36,469 --> 00:24:40,147
- Marie, I'm not ready yet.
- But you just said you were over him.

377
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,728
I am over him,
but I'm in a mourning period.

378
00:24:46,407 --> 00:24:48,732
- Who is it?
- Alex Anderson.

379
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,693
You fixed me up with him
six years ago.

380
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:55,320
Sorry. God.

381
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,947
All right, wait.
Here. Here we go.

382
00:24:58,138 --> 00:25:01,665
- Ken Darman.
- He's been married for over a year.

383
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:03,545
Really?

384
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:05,916
Married.

385
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,393
- Oh, wait. Wait, Wait.
- Look...

386
00:25:08,393 --> 00:25:08,794
I got one.

387
00:25:08,794 --> 00:25:11,811
There is no point in my going out
with someone I might really like

388
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:13,181
if I met him at the right time,

389
00:25:13,181 --> 00:25:14,713
but who right now has no chance

390
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:17,212
of being anything to me
but a transitional man.

391
00:25:17,247 --> 00:25:21,682
Okay, but don't wait too long. Remember
what happened with David Warsaw?

392
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:23,589
His wife left him
and everyone said

393
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:26,245
"Give him some time.
Don't move in too fast."

394
00:25:26,731 --> 00:25:29,105
Six months later
he was dead.

395
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,808
What are you saying, I should
get married to someone right away

396
00:25:31,808 --> 00:25:33,422
in case he's about to die?

397
00:25:33,457 --> 00:25:35,566
At least you could say
you were married.

398
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:39,376
I'm saying that the right man,
he might be out there right now.

399
00:25:39,376 --> 00:25:41,259
And if you don't grab him,
someone else will,

400
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:42,842
and you'll have to spend
the rest of your life

401
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:45,965
knowing that someone else
is married to your husband.

402
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:52,366
Ten. Hut!

403
00:26:06,805 --> 00:26:10,754
- When did this happen?
- Friday. Helen comes home from work

404
00:26:10,892 --> 00:26:14,342
and she says "I don't know
if I wanna be married any more."

405
00:26:14,478 --> 00:26:17,287
Like it's the institution.
You know, like it's nothing personal,

406
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:20,222
just something she's been
thinking about in a casual way.

407
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:23,873
I'm calm. I say "Why don't we take
some time to think about it?

408
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,197
You know,
don't rush into anything."

409
00:26:25,197 --> 00:26:28,027
- Yeah, right.
- Next day she says she's thought about it.

410
00:26:28,326 --> 00:26:31,823
And she wants a trial separation.
She just wants to try it, she says.

411
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:35,033
But we can still date.
Like this is supposed to cushion the blow.

412
00:26:35,229 --> 00:26:36,953
Man, I got married
so I could stop dating,

413
00:26:36,953 --> 00:26:39,839
so I don't see why we can still date
is any big incentive

414
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,876
since the last thing you wanna do
is date your wife,

415
00:26:41,876 --> 00:26:43,331
who's supposed to love you.

416
00:26:43,366 --> 00:26:44,480
Which is what
I'm saying to her,

417
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,068
when it occurs to me
that maybe she doesn't.

418
00:26:47,227 --> 00:26:50,225
So I say to her
"Don't you love me any more?"

419
00:26:50,225 --> 00:26:53,482
D'you know what she says?
"I don't know if I've ever loved you."

420
00:26:53,482 --> 00:26:57,595
Ooh, that's harsh. You don't
bounce back from that right away.

421
00:26:57,721 --> 00:27:00,721
- Thanks, Jess.
- No, I'm a writer. I know dialogue.

422
00:27:01,155 --> 00:27:02,472
And that's particularly harsh.

423
00:27:02,757 --> 00:27:06,168
Then she tells me that somebody
in her office is going to South America

424
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:10,645
and she can sublet his apartment.
I can't believe this. And the doorbell rings.

425
00:27:10,773 --> 00:27:13,494
"I can sublet his apartment"...
The words are still hanging in the air

426
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:15,907
you know, like in a balloon
attached to a mouth...

427
00:27:15,907 --> 00:27:17,294
- Like a cartoon.
- Right.

428
00:27:17,329 --> 00:27:22,027
So I go to the door and there are moving
men there. Now I start to get suspicious.

429
00:27:22,277 --> 00:27:24,699
I say "Helen, when did you call
these movers?"

430
00:27:24,699 --> 00:27:26,233
And she doesn't say anything.

431
00:27:26,293 --> 00:27:28,970
So I ask the movers "When did
this woman book you for this gig?"

432
00:27:29,085 --> 00:27:31,649
And they're just standing there.
Three huge guys, one of them

433
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:34,523
wearing a T-shirt that says
"Don't fuck with Mr Zero."

434
00:27:34,523 --> 00:27:39,747
So I said "Helen, when did you make this
arrangement?" She says "A week ago."

435
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:43,082
I said "You've known for a week
and you didn't tell me?"

436
00:27:43,215 --> 00:27:46,635
And she says
"I didn't wanna ruin your birthday."

437
00:27:49,185 --> 00:27:52,626
You're saying Mr. Zero knew you were
getting a divorce a week before you did?

438
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:54,505
- Mr. Zero knew.
- I can't believe this.

439
00:27:54,505 --> 00:27:56,274
I haven't told you
the bad part yet.

440
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,366
What could be worse
than Mr Zero knowing?

441
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,490
It's all a lie.

442
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:05,601
She's in love with somebody else.
Some tax attorney.

443
00:28:05,761 --> 00:28:08,779
- She moved in with him.
- How did you find out?

444
00:28:10,013 --> 00:28:12,108
I followed her.
Stood outside the building.

445
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:15,088
- That's so humiliating.
- Tell me about it.

446
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:18,165
And, you know, I knew.
I knew the whole time

447
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:19,924
that even though we were happy,
it was an illusion.

448
00:28:19,924 --> 00:28:22,744
And that one day
she would kick the shit outta me.

449
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:25,407
Marriages don't break up
on account of infidelity.

450
00:28:25,551 --> 00:28:28,139
It's just a symptom that
something else is wrong.

451
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:30,866
Oh, really? Well,
that symptom is fucking my wife.

452
00:28:35,516 --> 00:28:38,700
So I just happened to see
his American Express bill.

453
00:28:39,956 --> 00:28:42,195
What do you mean
"just happened" to see it?

454
00:28:42,593 --> 00:28:46,402
Well, he was... shaving,
and... there it was in his briefcase.

455
00:28:46,422 --> 00:28:48,803
What if he came out and
saw you look into his briefcase?

456
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,805
You're missing the point.
I'm telling you what I found.

457
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:57,135
He just spent 120 dollars
on a new nightgown for his wife.

458
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:00,572
I don't think
he's ever gonna leave her.

459
00:29:00,795 --> 00:29:03,596
No one thinks
he's ever gonna leave her.

460
00:29:03,631 --> 00:29:06,044
You're right, you're right.
I know you're right.

461
00:29:21,662 --> 00:29:25,161
Someone is staring at you
in Personal Growth.

462
00:29:27,987 --> 00:29:31,366
I know him.
You'd like him. He's married.

463
00:29:32,178 --> 00:29:36,222
- Who is he?
- Harry Burns. He's a political consultant.

464
00:29:36,768 --> 00:29:38,244
He's cute.

465
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:41,551
- You think he's cute?
- How do you know he's married?

466
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:43,843
Cause last time I saw him
he was getting married.

467
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:47,062
- When was that?
- Six years ago.

468
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,086
So he might not
be married any more.

469
00:29:50,597 --> 00:29:52,429
Also, he's obnoxious.

470
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:55,398
This is just like in the movies,
remember, "The Lady Vanishes",

471
00:29:55,398 --> 00:29:57,202
when she says to him
"You're the most obnoxious man"...

472
00:29:57,202 --> 00:30:00,253
- "The most contemptible".
- ... then they fall madly in love.

473
00:30:00,288 --> 00:30:03,476
- Also, he never remembers me.
- Sally Albright.

474
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:07,577
- Hi, Harry.
- I thought it was you.

475
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:10,327
It is. This is Marie.

476
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:13,619
Was Marie.

477
00:30:13,753 --> 00:30:15,792
- How are you?
- Fine.

478
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:18,678
- How's Joe?
- Fine.

479
00:30:19,142 --> 00:30:20,861
I hear he's fine.

480
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,985
- You're not with Joe any more?
- We just broke up.

481
00:30:26,323 --> 00:30:28,532
I'm sorry. That's too bad.

482
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,671
Yeah. Well, you know.

483
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:33,219
Yeah.

484
00:30:33,352 --> 00:30:34,705
So...

485
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,512
- What about you?
- I'm fine.

486
00:30:37,647 --> 00:30:39,686
How's married life?

487
00:30:40,816 --> 00:30:43,848
Not so good.
I'm getting a divorce.

488
00:30:44,027 --> 00:30:48,149
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

489
00:30:48,489 --> 00:30:50,731
Yeah, well,
what're you gonna do?

490
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:53,074
What happened with you guys?

491
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,380
When Joe and I started seeing each other
we wanted exactly the same thing.

492
00:30:57,758 --> 00:31:00,061
We wanted to live together
but we didn't wanna get married

493
00:31:00,061 --> 00:31:02,347
because every time
anyone we knew got married,

494
00:31:02,347 --> 00:31:06,015
it ruined their relationship.
They practically never had sex again.

495
00:31:06,307 --> 00:31:09,834
It's true. That's one of the secrets
that no one ever tells you.

496
00:31:10,206 --> 00:31:12,672
I would sit around with my girlfriends
who have kids and...

497
00:31:13,034 --> 00:31:15,756
Actually, my-my one girlfriend
who has kids, Alice,

498
00:31:15,756 --> 00:31:19,392
and she would complain about
how she and Gary never did it any more.

499
00:31:20,135 --> 00:31:22,411
She didn't even complain about it,
now that I think about it.

500
00:31:22,411 --> 00:31:23,732
She just said it matter-of-factly.

501
00:31:23,732 --> 00:31:27,265
She said... they were up all night,
they were both exhausted all the time,

502
00:31:27,265 --> 00:31:30,835
the kids just took every sexual impulse
they had out of them.

503
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,724
Joe and I used to talk about it
and we would say

504
00:31:34,724 --> 00:31:37,597
"We're so lucky.
We have this wonderful relationship.

505
00:31:37,597 --> 00:31:41,880
We can... have sex on the kitchen floor
and not worry about the kids walking in."

506
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:44,794
"We can fly off to Rome
on a moment's notice."

507
00:31:46,912 --> 00:31:50,285
And then one day I was taking
Alice's girl for the afternoon

508
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:55,698
cause I promised to take her to the circus.
And... we were in the cab playing I-spy.

509
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,530
"I spy a mailbox",
"I spy a lamp post".

510
00:31:59,346 --> 00:32:03,001
And she looked out the window
and she saw this man and this woman

511
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:07,108
with these two little kids, and the... man
had one of the kids on his shoulders.

512
00:32:07,431 --> 00:32:10,587
And she said...
"I spy a family."

513
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:16,301
And I started to cry.
You know, I just started crying.

514
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:20,436
And I went home
and I said "The thing is, Joe,

515
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:23,682
we never do fly off to Rome
on a moment's notice."

516
00:32:23,982 --> 00:32:25,641
And the kitchen floor...?

517
00:32:26,457 --> 00:32:30,983
Not once. It's this very cold,
hard, Mexican ceramic tile.

518
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:34,805
Anyway,

519
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:36,911
we talked about it
for a long time.

520
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:40,232
And I said "This is what I want"
and he said "Well, I don't".

521
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:44,197
And I said "Well, I guess it's over."
And he left.

522
00:32:46,905 --> 00:32:50,908
And the thing is,
I... I feel really fine.

523
00:32:50,964 --> 00:32:54,044
I am over him.
I mean, I really am over him.

524
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:57,375
That was it for him.
That was the most that he could give.

525
00:32:57,603 --> 00:32:59,171
And every time
I think about it,

526
00:32:59,171 --> 00:33:02,305
I am more and more convinced
that I did the right thing.

527
00:33:02,801 --> 00:33:04,790
Boy, you sound really healthy.

528
00:33:05,395 --> 00:33:06,589
Yeah.

529
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:11,015
- At least I got the apartment.
- That's what everybody says to me too.

530
00:33:11,015 --> 00:33:13,248
But really, what's so hard
about finding an apartment?

531
00:33:13,475 --> 00:33:15,933
What you do is
you read the obituary column.

532
00:33:15,968 --> 00:33:17,804
You find out who died,
go to the building,

533
00:33:17,804 --> 00:33:19,308
and then you tip the doorman.

534
00:33:19,443 --> 00:33:20,927
What they could do
to make it easier

535
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:23,824
is combine the obituaries
with the real-estate section.

536
00:33:23,824 --> 00:33:27,124
Say, then you have "Mr Klein died,
say, leaving a wife, two children

537
00:33:27,168 --> 00:33:28,851
and a spacious
three-bedroom apartment

538
00:33:28,851 --> 00:33:30,607
with a wood- burning fireplace."

539
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:37,324
You know, the first time we met
I really didn't like you that much.

540
00:33:37,614 --> 00:33:39,284
- I didn't like you.
- Yeah, you did.

541
00:33:39,424 --> 00:33:42,137
You were just so uptight then.
You're much softer now.

542
00:33:43,093 --> 00:33:44,884
You know, I hate
that kind of remark.

543
00:33:44,884 --> 00:33:47,450
It sounds like a compliment,
but really it's an insult.

544
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,481
Okay, you're still
as hard as nails.

545
00:33:49,566 --> 00:33:51,113
I just didn't wanna
sleep with you

546
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:52,980
and you had to write it off
as a character flaw,

547
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,707
instead of dealing
with the possibility

548
00:33:54,707 --> 00:33:56,764
that it might have
something to do with you.

549
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:01,862
What's the statute of limitations
on apologies?

550
00:34:03,456 --> 00:34:06,534
- Ten years.
- Ooh, I can just get it in under the wire.

551
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:14,397
Would you like to have
dinner with me sometime?

552
00:34:15,078 --> 00:34:17,312
Are we becoming friends now?

553
00:34:19,035 --> 00:34:20,390
Well...

554
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,106
Yeah.

555
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:28,122
Great. A woman friend.

556
00:34:28,803 --> 00:34:30,650
You know, you may be
the first attractive woman

557
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:33,393
I've not wanted to sleep with
in my entire life.

558
00:34:33,877 --> 00:34:36,119
That's wonderful, Harry.

559
00:34:37,693 --> 00:34:40,049
We were both born
in the same hospital...

560
00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:41,061
In 1921.

561
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:43,254
- .. seven days apart.
- In the same hospital.

562
00:34:43,385 --> 00:34:46,504
- We both grew up one block apart.
- We both lived in tenements.

563
00:34:46,638 --> 00:34:49,508
- On the Lower East Side.
- On Delancey Street.

564
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,724
- My family moved to the Bronx when I was ten.
- He lived on Fordham Road.

565
00:34:52,955 --> 00:34:55,804
- Hers moved when she was 11.
- I lived on 183rd Street.

566
00:34:55,937 --> 00:34:59,618
For 6 years, she worked
on the 15th floor...

567
00:34:59,618 --> 00:35:00,883
I worked
for a prominent neurologist.

568
00:35:00,883 --> 00:35:01,047
... as a nurse,

569
00:35:01,047 --> 00:35:04,199
- where I had a practice on the 14th floor.
- Dr. Permelman.

570
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,244
The very same building.

571
00:35:05,244 --> 00:35:06,857
- We never met.
- Never met.

572
00:35:06,987 --> 00:35:10,652
- Can you imagine that?
- You know where we met? In an elevator.

573
00:35:10,782 --> 00:35:13,652
- I was visiting family.
- In the Ambassador Hotel in Chicago.

574
00:35:13,784 --> 00:35:16,453
He was on the third floor,
I was on the 12th.

575
00:35:16,578 --> 00:35:20,196
I rode up nine extra floors
just to keep talking to her.

576
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:22,786
Nine extra floors.

577
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:35,587
- Hello.
- You sleeping?

578
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:38,470
- No, I was watching "Casablanca".
- Channel, please?

579
00:35:38,596 --> 00:35:41,300
- Eleven.
- Thank you. Got it.

580
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:44,342
Now, you're telling me
you'd be happier with Victor Laszlo

581
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,675
than with Humphrey Bogart?

582
00:35:45,851 --> 00:35:48,531
- When did I say that?
- When we drove to New York.

583
00:35:48,998 --> 00:35:53,314
- I never said that. I would never say that.
- All right, fine. Have it your way.

584
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:57,315
- You been sleeping?
- Why?

585
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:01,358
Cause I haven't been sleeping.
I really miss Helen.

586
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,706
Maybe I'm coming down
with something.

587
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:06,280
Last night, I was up
at 4 in the morning

588
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,364
watching "Leave It to Beaver"
in Spanish.

589
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:11,948
"Buenos das, Seor Cleaver.
Dnde estn Wallace y Theodore?"

590
00:36:12,428 --> 00:36:13,362
I'm not well.

591
00:36:13,737 --> 00:36:17,618
Well, I went to bed at 7.30 last night.
I haven't done that since the third grade.

592
00:36:17,811 --> 00:36:20,480
Well, that's the good thing
about depression. Get your rest.

593
00:36:21,006 --> 00:36:23,704
- I'm not depressed.
- Okay, fine.

594
00:36:24,406 --> 00:36:26,960
Do you still sleep
on the same side of the bed?

595
00:36:27,067 --> 00:36:30,014
I did for a while, but now
I'm pretty much using the whole bed.

596
00:36:30,049 --> 00:36:34,529
God, that's great. I feel weird
when just my leg wanders over.

597
00:36:35,516 --> 00:36:36,847
I miss her.

598
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:41,241
- I don't miss him. I really don't.
- Not even a little?

599
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,212
You know what I miss?

600
00:36:43,606 --> 00:36:46,488
I miss the idea of him.

601
00:36:47,703 --> 00:36:50,470
Maybe I only miss
the idea of Helen.

602
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:53,317
No, I miss the whole Helen.

603
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,248
Last scene.

604
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:05,099
<i>Goodbye, Rick.
God bless you.</i>

605
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:08,327
Ooh, Ingrid Bergman.
Now, she's low maintenance.

606
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:11,032
- Low maintenance?
- There are two kinds of women.

607
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:13,289
High maintenance
and low maintenance.

608
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:15,374
And Ingrid Bergman
is low maintenance?

609
00:37:15,811 --> 00:37:17,940
An LM, definitely.

610
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:20,072
- Which one am I?
- You're the worst kind.

611
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,350
You're high maintenance but
you think you're low maintenance.

612
00:37:22,837 --> 00:37:24,879
- I don't see that.
- You don't see that?

613
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:27,087
"Waiter, I'll begin
with a house salad,

614
00:37:27,087 --> 00:37:28,480
but I don't want
the regular dressing.

615
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,140
I'll have the balsamic vinegar
and oil, but on the side.

616
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,606
And then the salmon
with mustard sauce,

617
00:37:32,606 --> 00:37:34,597
but I want the mustard sauce
on the side."

618
00:37:34,597 --> 00:37:36,496
"On the side" is
a very big thing for you.

619
00:37:36,496 --> 00:37:38,400
No, I just want it
the way I want it.

620
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,481
I know.
High maintenance.

621
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:43,721
<i>Well, 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.</i>

622
00:37:43,913 --> 00:37:45,339
<i>Our expenses?</i>

623
00:37:46,094 --> 00:37:50,597
<i>Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.</i>

624
00:37:51,971 --> 00:37:54,586
Ooh, best last line
of a movie ever.

625
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,961
I'm definitely coming down
with something.

626
00:38:00,224 --> 00:38:02,849
Probably a 24-hour tumour.
They're going around.

627
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:04,784
- You don't have a tumour.
- How do you know?

628
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:09,270
- If you're so worried, go see a doctor.
- No, he'll just tell me it's nothing.

629
00:38:10,075 --> 00:38:12,815
- Will you be able to sleep?
- If not, I'll be okay.

630
00:38:12,815 --> 00:38:16,140
- What'll you do?
- I'll stay up and moan.

631
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,183
Maybe I should practise now.

632
00:38:24,228 --> 00:38:28,411
- Good night, Harry.
- Good night.

633
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:08,696
I had my dream again. Where I'm making
love and Olympic judges are watching?

634
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:11,634
I'd nailed the compulsories,
so this is it. The finals.

635
00:39:11,841 --> 00:39:15,217
I got a 9.8 from the Canadian,
a perfect 10 from the American,

636
00:39:15,576 --> 00:39:19,058
and my mother, disguised as
an East German judge, gave me a 5.6.

637
00:39:19,197 --> 00:39:20,671
Must've been the dismount.

638
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:24,644
And basically it's the same one
I've been having since I was 12.

639
00:39:24,886 --> 00:39:28,079
- What happens?
- No, it's... It's too embarrassing.

640
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,482
- Don't tell me.
- Okay, there's this guy.

641
00:39:30,482 --> 00:39:34,132
- What's he look like?
- I don't know. He's just kinda faceless.

642
00:39:34,132 --> 00:39:36,412
A faceless guy.
Okay. Then what?

643
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:39,446
He rips off my clothes.

644
00:39:39,827 --> 00:39:43,117
- Then what happens?
- That's it.

645
00:39:44,723 --> 00:39:47,782
That's it? A faceless guy
rips off your clothes

646
00:39:47,782 --> 00:39:49,423
and that's the sex fantasy
you've been having

647
00:39:49,423 --> 00:39:52,115
since you were 12.
Exactly the same.

648
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,922
Well, sometimes
I vary it a little.

649
00:39:54,894 --> 00:39:57,173
- Which part?
- What I'm wearing.

650
00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:04,679
- What?
- Nothing.

651
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:10,178
I have decided that
for the rest of the day

652
00:40:10,313 --> 00:40:13,365
we are going to talk
like this.

653
00:40:13,365 --> 00:40:16,782
- Like this?
- No. Please. To repeat after me.

654
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:17,992
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

655
00:40:17,992 --> 00:40:19,125
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

656
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,044
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

657
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:21,025
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

658
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:24,692
Waiter, there is too much pepper
on my paprikash.

659
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:30,328
Waiter, there is too much pepper...
on my paprikash.

660
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:33,309
But I would be proud
to partake of your pecan pie.

661
00:40:33,983 --> 00:40:35,517
Oh, no.

662
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:37,787
- But I would be proud...
- But I would be proud...

663
00:40:37,787 --> 00:40:38,940
- ... to partake...
- ... to partake...

664
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,323
- ... of your pecan pie.
- ... of your pecan pie.

665
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:44,186
- Pecan pie.
- Pecan pie.

666
00:40:44,186 --> 00:40:46,696
- Pecan pie.
- Pecan pie.

667
00:40:47,622 --> 00:40:49,975
Would you like to go
to the movies with me tonight?

668
00:40:49,975 --> 00:40:51,076
Would you like to go...
what-what...

669
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:53,514
Not to repeat.
Please, to answer.

670
00:40:53,731 --> 00:40:57,338
Would you like to go
to the movies with me... tonight?

671
00:40:57,338 --> 00:41:01,694
Oh... Oh... Well, I'd love to, Harry,
but I-I can't.

672
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:04,313
What do you have?
A hot date?

673
00:41:04,877 --> 00:41:07,603
- Well, yeah. Yeah.
- Really?

674
00:41:07,638 --> 00:41:09,704
Yeah. I wa... was gonna tell you,
but, I don't know,

675
00:41:09,704 --> 00:41:11,901
I just... I felt strange
about it.

676
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:12,481
Why?

677
00:41:12,481 --> 00:41:14,633
Well, because we've been spending
so much time together.

678
00:41:14,633 --> 00:41:17,001
Oh, I think it's great
that you have a date.

679
00:41:17,036 --> 00:41:18,901
- You do?
- Yeah.

680
00:41:25,892 --> 00:41:28,578
- Is that what you're gonna wear?
- Yeah.

681
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:32,055
Well, I don't-don't know. Why?

682
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:36,137
I think you should wear skirts more.
You look really good in skirts.

683
00:41:36,137 --> 00:41:37,716
- I do?
- Yeah.

684
00:41:40,301 --> 00:41:42,466
You know, I have a theory
that hieroglyphics are really

685
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:45,730
an ancient comic strip about
a character named Sphinxy.

686
00:41:45,765 --> 00:41:47,658
You know, Harry, I think
you should get out there, too.

687
00:41:47,658 --> 00:41:49,343
Oh, I'm not ready.

688
00:41:49,378 --> 00:41:50,389
You should.

689
00:41:50,389 --> 00:41:52,982
I would not be good
for anybody right now.

690
00:41:52,982 --> 00:41:54,452
It's time.

691
00:41:54,987 --> 00:41:57,857
It was the most
uncomfortable night of my life.

692
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,245
See, no,
it has to go this way.

693
00:42:01,509 --> 00:42:04,079
The first date back
is always the toughest, Harry.

694
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,152
You only had one date.

695
00:42:06,587 --> 00:42:08,609
How do you know
it's not gonna get worse?

696
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:10,269
How much worse can it get

697
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:12,329
than finishing dinner,
having him reach over,

698
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:15,744
pull a hair out of my head and
start flossing with it at the table?

699
00:42:15,779 --> 00:42:18,367
We're talking dream date
compared to my horror.

700
00:42:18,652 --> 00:42:22,033
It started out fine.
She's a very nice person.

701
00:42:22,432 --> 00:42:23,747
And we're sitting
and we're talking

702
00:42:23,747 --> 00:42:26,246
in this Ethiopian restaurant
that she wanted to go to.

703
00:42:26,281 --> 00:42:27,893
I was making jokes,
you know, like

704
00:42:27,893 --> 00:42:29,965
"Hey, I didn't know that
they had food in Ethiopia."

705
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,135
"This'll be a quick meal. I'll order
two empty plates and we can leave."

706
00:42:33,685 --> 00:42:36,223
Yeah. Nothing from her,
not even a smile.

707
00:42:36,269 --> 00:42:39,443
So I downshift into small talk and
I ask here where she went to school.

708
00:42:39,443 --> 00:42:42,558
And she says Michigan State.
This reminds me of Helen.

709
00:42:42,984 --> 00:42:46,310
All of a sudden I'm in the middle
of this massive anxiety attack.

710
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:49,299
My heart's beatin' like a wild man
and I start sweatin' like a pig.

711
00:42:49,352 --> 00:42:52,531
- Helen went to Michigan State?
- No, she went to Northwestern.

712
00:42:52,566 --> 00:42:54,355
But they're both
Big Ten schools.

713
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:57,477
I got so upset
I had to leave the restaurant.

714
00:43:00,003 --> 00:43:02,166
Harry, I think
this takes a long time.

715
00:43:02,465 --> 00:43:04,421
It might be months
before we're actually able

716
00:43:04,421 --> 00:43:06,665
to enjoy going out
with someone new.

717
00:43:06,912 --> 00:43:07,533
Yeah.

718
00:43:07,723 --> 00:43:10,167
And maybe longer,
before we're actually able

719
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:11,371
to go to bed
with someone new.

720
00:43:11,371 --> 00:43:13,095
Oh, I went to bed with her.

721
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,368
- You went to bed with her?:
- Sure.

722
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:26,881
- I don't understand this relationship.
- What d'ya mean?

723
00:43:26,881 --> 00:43:28,642
- You enjoy being with her?
- Yeah.

724
00:43:28,642 --> 00:43:30,497
- You find her attractive?
- Yeah.

725
00:43:30,871 --> 00:43:32,749
- And you're not sleeping with her?
- No.

726
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,637
You're afraid
to let yourself be happy.

727
00:43:35,712 --> 00:43:39,259
Why can't you gimme credit for this?
This is a big thing for me.

728
00:43:39,274 --> 00:43:42,064
I never had a relationship
with a woman that didn't involve sex.

729
00:43:42,064 --> 00:43:43,490
See, like I'm growing.

730
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,783
Are you finished?

731
00:43:44,783 --> 00:43:47,345
Hey, I got a whole stack o' quarters.
And I was here first.

732
00:43:47,345 --> 00:43:48,389
- Were not.
- Was too.

733
00:43:48,389 --> 00:43:49,665
- Were not.
- Was too.

734
00:43:50,202 --> 00:43:52,765
- Big jerk.
- Little creep.

735
00:43:52,771 --> 00:43:54,870
- Where was I?
- You were growing.

736
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:55,622
Yeah.

737
00:43:56,536 --> 00:43:59,907
It's very freeing.
I can say anything to her.

738
00:44:00,372 --> 00:44:03,419
Are you saying you can say things
to her you can't say to me?

739
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:06,512
No, it's just different.
It's a whole different perspective.

740
00:44:06,663 --> 00:44:09,039
I get the woman's
point of view on things.

741
00:44:09,074 --> 00:44:10,836
She tells me about the men
that she goes out with,

742
00:44:12,899 --> 00:44:14,956
- You tell her about other women?
- Yeah.

743
00:44:14,956 --> 00:44:18,812
Like the other night. I made love
to this woman and it was so incredible...

744
00:44:18,847 --> 00:44:22,089
I took her to a place that wasn't human.
She actually meowed.

745
00:44:22,608 --> 00:44:23,996
You made a woman meow?

746
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:27,094
Yeah, that's the point.
I can say these things to her.

747
00:44:27,225 --> 00:44:29,429
And the great thing is,
I don't have to lie

748
00:44:29,429 --> 00:44:31,843
because I'm not always thinking
about how to get her into bed.

749
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:35,608
- I can just be myself.
- You made a woman meow?

750
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:40,246
What do you do with these women?
You just get up out of bed and leave?

751
00:44:40,246 --> 00:44:41,066
Sure.

752
00:44:41,164 --> 00:44:43,789
Oh, explain to me how you do it.
What do you say?

753
00:44:43,824 --> 00:44:46,405
I say I have an early meeting,
early hair cut or a squash game.

754
00:44:46,405 --> 00:44:49,278
- You don't play squash.
- They don't know that. They just met me.

755
00:44:50,807 --> 00:44:53,330
- That's disgusting.
- I know. I feel terrible.

756
00:44:53,749 --> 00:44:56,179
You know, I'm so glad
I never got involved with you.

757
00:44:56,288 --> 00:44:58,018
I just would've ended up
being some woman

758
00:44:58,018 --> 00:45:00,391
you had to get outta bed
and leave at 3 oclock in the morning

759
00:45:00,391 --> 00:45:03,785
and go clean your andirons.
And you don't even have a fireplace.

760
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:04,953
Not that I would know this.

761
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:07,460
Why are you getting so upset?
This isn not about you.

762
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:11,834
Yes, it is. You are a human affront
to all women, and I am a woman.

763
00:45:11,937 --> 00:45:14,811
Hey, I don't feel great about this
but I don't hear anyone complaining.

764
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:17,165
Of course not.
You're out the door too fast.

765
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:21,315
- I think they have an okay time.
- How do you know?

766
00:45:21,954 --> 00:45:23,588
What d'you mean
how do I know? I know.

767
00:45:24,285 --> 00:45:27,904
- Because they...
- Yes, because they...

768
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,962
How do you know
that they're really...

769
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:34,520
What are you saying?
That they fake orgasm?

770
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:36,787
- It's possible.
- Get outta here.

771
00:45:36,862 --> 00:45:39,575
Why? Most women
at one time or another have faked it.

772
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:43,358
- Well, they haven't faked it with me.
- How do you know?

773
00:45:44,439 --> 00:45:45,941
Because I know.

774
00:45:47,669 --> 00:45:53,515
Oh... Right. That's right.
I forgot. You're a man.

775
00:45:53,515 --> 00:45:55,586
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

776
00:45:55,674 --> 00:45:57,687
It's just that all men are sure
it never happened to them

777
00:45:57,687 --> 00:45:59,590
and most women at one time
or another have done it,

778
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,141
so you do the math.

779
00:46:01,806 --> 00:46:04,029
You don't think that
I can tell the difference?

780
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,818
- No.
- Get outta here.

781
00:46:21,669 --> 00:46:23,315
Are you okay?

782
00:46:27,475 --> 00:46:29,656
Oh, God.

783
00:46:30,367 --> 00:46:32,575
Ooh, oh, God.

784
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:42,351
Oh, God.

785
00:46:42,417 --> 00:46:44,109
Oh, yeah, right there.

786
00:46:50,655 --> 00:46:52,251
Oh, God.

787
00:46:53,142 --> 00:46:59,242
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Yes. Yes. Yes.

788
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,137
Oh, yes: Yes: Yes:

789
00:47:05,837 --> 00:47:11,708
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Yes. Yes. Yes.

790
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:17,073
Oh, God.

791
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,188
I'll have
what she's having.

792
00:48:14,409 --> 00:48:16,069
He'll say "Are you married?"

793
00:48:53,329 --> 00:48:55,531
I like you without your beard.
You see your face.

794
00:48:55,531 --> 00:48:56,722
And it's my face.

795
00:48:58,243 --> 00:49:00,021
- Whoa! Dipping you.
- Oh!

796
00:49:03,592 --> 00:49:05,646
I really wanna thank you
for taking me out tonight.

797
00:49:05,646 --> 00:49:06,754
Oh, don't be silly.

798
00:49:06,754 --> 00:49:10,197
The next New Year's Eve, if neither
of us is with anybody, you got a date.

799
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,048
Deal.

800
00:49:13,831 --> 00:49:16,363
See? Now we can dance
cheek to cheek.

801
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,963
That I love you a lot

802
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:45,596
Hey, everybody!
Ten seconds to New Year.

803
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,479
- Ten, nine...
- Wanna get some air?

804
00:49:48,514 --> 00:49:51,918
- Yeah.
- ... seven, six, five, four,

805
00:49:52,007 --> 00:49:55,594
three, two, one!
Happy New Year!

806
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:19,062
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

807
00:50:27,686 --> 00:50:30,140
He was a head counsellor
at the boys' camp,

808
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:32,408
and I was a head counsellor
at girls' camp,

809
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:36,619
and they had a social one night,
and he walked across the room.

810
00:50:36,859 --> 00:50:39,440
I thought he was coming
to talk to my friend Maxine,

811
00:50:39,853 --> 00:50:43,315
cause people were always
crossing rooms to talk to Maxine.

812
00:50:43,837 --> 00:50:46,279
But he was coming to talk to me,
and he said

813
00:50:46,813 --> 00:50:49,406
"I'm Ben Small
of the Coney Island Smalls."

814
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:53,993
At that moment I knew. I knew
the way you know about a good melon.

815
00:50:56,472 --> 00:50:58,665
You sent flowers to yourself.

816
00:50:59,392 --> 00:51:03,425
60 dollars I spent on this big stupid
arrangement of flowers, and I wrote a card

817
00:51:03,425 --> 00:51:04,777
that I planned to leave
on the front table

818
00:51:04,777 --> 00:51:06,948
where Arthur would just...
happen to see it.

819
00:51:07,155 --> 00:51:08,838
What did the card say?

820
00:51:09,713 --> 00:51:12,503
"Please say yes.
Love, Jonathan."

821
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:14,936
- Did it work?
- He never even came over.

822
00:51:14,936 --> 00:51:19,143
He forgot this charity thing that his wife is
chairman of. He's never gonna leave her.

823
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:20,085
Of course he isn't.

824
00:51:20,085 --> 00:51:22,377
You're right, you're right.
I know you're right.

825
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:25,461
- Where is this place?
- Somewhere on the next block.

826
00:51:25,597 --> 00:51:28,253
Ohh! I can't believe
I'm doing this.

827
00:51:28,534 --> 00:51:32,018
Look, Harry is one of my best friends
and you are one of my best friends.

828
00:51:32,018 --> 00:51:33,930
And if by some chance
you two hit it off,

829
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:36,726
then we can all still be friends,
instead of... drifting apart

830
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:37,923
the way you do
when you get involved

831
00:51:37,923 --> 00:51:39,566
with someone
who doesn't know your friends.

832
00:51:39,566 --> 00:51:42,565
You and I haven't drifted apart
since I started seeing Arthur.

833
00:51:43,753 --> 00:51:47,434
If Arthur ever left his wife
and I actually met him,

834
00:51:47,434 --> 00:51:50,630
I am sure that you and I
would drift apart.

835
00:51:51,034 --> 00:51:55,335
- He's never gonna leave her.
- Of course he isn't.

836
00:51:55,505 --> 00:51:57,636
You're right, you're right.
I know you're right.

837
00:51:58,195 --> 00:52:00,506
- I dunno about this.
- It's just a dinner.

838
00:52:00,506 --> 00:52:02,363
You know, I've finally gotten
to a place in my life

839
00:52:02,363 --> 00:52:05,353
where I'm comfortable with the fact
that it's just me and my work.

840
00:52:05,861 --> 00:52:07,619
If she's so great,
why aren't you taking her out?

841
00:52:07,619 --> 00:52:09,919
How many times do I have
to tell you? We're just friends.

842
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:11,414
So you're saying
she's not that attractive?

843
00:52:11,414 --> 00:52:13,039
No, I told you,
she is attractive.

844
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:14,832
Yeah, but you also said
she had a good personality.

845
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:16,343
She has a good personality.

846
00:52:19,073 --> 00:52:20,227
What?

847
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:22,310
When someone's not
that attractive,

848
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:25,324
they're always described
as having a good personality.

849
00:52:25,324 --> 00:52:27,184
Look. If you would ask me
what does she look like

850
00:52:27,184 --> 00:52:30,534
and I said "She has a good personality",
that means she's not attractive.

851
00:52:30,544 --> 00:52:33,458
But just because I happened to mention
that she has a good personality,

852
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:34,631
she could be either.

853
00:52:34,631 --> 00:52:36,454
She could be attractive
with a good personality,

854
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:38,313
or not attractive
with a good personality.

855
00:52:38,313 --> 00:52:40,542
- So which one is she?
- Attractive.

856
00:52:40,542 --> 00:52:42,328
But not beautiful, right?

857
00:52:45,435 --> 00:52:47,717
It's like, whenever
I read Jimmy Breslin,

858
00:52:47,717 --> 00:52:51,034
it's as if he's leaving
some kind of a... a wake-up call

859
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:55,328
- for the City of New York.
- What d'you mean by "a wake-up call"?

860
00:52:55,328 --> 00:52:58,984
He's-he's saying that actually we've got
people in the city who live on welfare...

861
00:52:58,984 --> 00:53:02,860
Would I... would I have seen
any of... any of your windows?

862
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:07,290
A couple of weeks ago
I did a... I did a thing with... hostages.

863
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:09,347
- The people in blindfolds.
- Yeah.

864
00:53:09,847 --> 00:53:12,260
I thought it was like late '80s.

865
00:53:13,727 --> 00:53:14,600
That's in-interesting.

866
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:18,332
Let's just say I'm really not
a big fan of Jimmy Breslin.

867
00:53:18,332 --> 00:53:21,932
Well, he's the reason I became
a writer, but that's not important.

868
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:39,303
Harry, you and Marie
are both from New Jersey.

869
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:40,952
- Really?
- Where are you from?

870
00:53:40,952 --> 00:53:42,846
- South Orange.
- Haddonfield.

871
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:54,751
- So, what are we gonna order?
- I'm gonna start with the grilled radicchio.

872
00:53:55,029 --> 00:53:56,781
Jess, Sally is a great orderer.

873
00:53:56,781 --> 00:53:58,615
Not only does she always pick
the best thing on the menu,

874
00:53:58,615 --> 00:54:01,905
but she orders it in a way that even
the chef didn't know how good it could be.

875
00:54:02,128 --> 00:54:04,004
I think restaurants
have become too important.

876
00:54:04,004 --> 00:54:05,471
I agree.

877
00:54:05,506 --> 00:54:09,246
"Restaurants are to people in the '80s
what theatre was to people in the '60s."

878
00:54:09,785 --> 00:54:13,683
- I read that in a magazine.
- I wrote that.

879
00:54:14,608 --> 00:54:17,371
- Get outta here.
- No, I did. I wrote that.

880
00:54:17,485 --> 00:54:20,995
I've never quoted anything from
a magazine in my life. That's amazing.

881
00:54:20,995 --> 00:54:23,529
Don't you think it's amazing?
And you wrote it?

882
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:27,132
I also wrote
"Pesto is quiche of the '80s."

883
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,211
- Get over yourself.
- I did.

884
00:54:30,363 --> 00:54:32,289
- Where did I read that?
- "New York Magazine".

885
00:54:32,767 --> 00:54:34,803
Sally writes
for "New York Magazine".

886
00:54:35,261 --> 00:54:39,771
You know, that piece had a real impact
on me. I-I don't know much about writing...

887
00:54:39,771 --> 00:54:42,198
It spoke to you,
and that pleases me.

888
00:54:42,198 --> 00:54:44,104
I-I mean, I really....
you have to admire

889
00:54:44,104 --> 00:54:46,296
people who-who can be
as... that articulate.

890
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:49,048
Nobody has ever quoted
me back to me before.

891
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:02,220
Oh! I've been looking for
a red suede pump.

892
00:55:04,821 --> 00:55:06,490
What do you think of Jess?

893
00:55:08,172 --> 00:55:09,454
Well, uh...

894
00:55:09,454 --> 00:55:11,376
Do you think
you could go out with him?

895
00:55:12,377 --> 00:55:15,868
- I don't know...
- Cause I feel really comfortable with him.

896
00:55:16,382 --> 00:55:19,642
- You wanna go out with Jess.
- If it would be all right with you.

897
00:55:19,745 --> 00:55:23,052
Sure. Sure.
I'm just worried about Harry.

898
00:55:23,052 --> 00:55:25,614
He's very sensitive,
he's going through a rough period,

899
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:28,236
and I... I just don't want you
to reject him right now.

900
00:55:28,236 --> 00:55:30,311
- I wouldn't. I totally understand.
- Okay.

901
00:55:30,656 --> 00:55:33,548
If you don't think you're gonna
call Marie, do you mind if I call her?

902
00:55:34,037 --> 00:55:35,754
- No, no.
- Good. Good. Good.

903
00:55:35,898 --> 00:55:37,168
But for tonight
you shouldn't.

904
00:55:37,683 --> 00:55:40,299
I mean, Sally's
very vulnerable right now.

905
00:55:40,334 --> 00:55:41,434
I mean,
you can call Marie, it's fine,

906
00:55:41,434 --> 00:55:42,943
but let's just wait a week or so,
you know?

907
00:55:43,204 --> 00:55:44,578
Don't make any moves tonight.

908
00:55:44,578 --> 00:55:47,123
Fine. No problem.
I wasn't even thinking about tonight.

909
00:55:48,622 --> 00:55:50,883
Well, I don't really feel much
like walking any more.

910
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:52,347
I think I'll get a cab.

911
00:55:52,347 --> 00:55:55,025
- I'll go with you.
- Great. Taxi!

912
00:56:07,061 --> 00:56:12,284
A man came to me and said
"I found nice girl for you."

913
00:56:12,823 --> 00:56:16,579
"She lives in the next village

914
00:56:17,314 --> 00:56:19,996
and she is ready for marriage."

915
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:25,466
We were not supposed to meet
until the wedding,

916
00:56:25,967 --> 00:56:27,669
but I wanted to make sure.

917
00:56:28,268 --> 00:56:32,132
So I sneak into her village,
hid behind a tree,

918
00:56:32,644 --> 00:56:35,721
watch her washing the clothes.

919
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:41,598
I think if I don't like the way
she looks, I don't marry her.

920
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:47,776
So I said "Okay" to the man.

921
00:56:49,127 --> 00:56:50,355
We get married.

922
00:56:50,812 --> 00:56:54,169
We married for 55 years.

923
00:57:01,172 --> 00:57:04,667
- I have to get this. I have to get this.
- Harry, we're here for Jess and Marie.

924
00:57:04,702 --> 00:57:07,328
I know. We'll find them something.
It's great stuff here.

925
00:57:07,328 --> 00:57:08,674
Should have gone
to the plant store.

926
00:57:08,674 --> 00:57:11,012
- Here. Perfect for them.
- What's that?

927
00:57:12,133 --> 00:57:14,505
Battery-operated
pith helmet, with fan.

928
00:57:14,966 --> 00:57:17,963
- Why is this necessary in life?
- I don't know.

929
00:57:17,963 --> 00:57:20,717
Look. Look at this.
Also makes great fries.

930
00:57:21,061 --> 00:57:24,824
Oh... Oh-ho. Good.
Call off the dogs. The hunt is over.

931
00:57:25,047 --> 00:57:27,713
Sally, this is the greatest.

932
00:57:28,114 --> 00:57:30,523
Sally, please report to me.

933
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,022
Look at this. This is the greatest.
You're gonna love this.

934
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:37,776
This is a singing machine.
Look, you sing the-the-the lead

935
00:57:37,776 --> 00:57:39,115
and this has the backup
and everything.

936
00:57:39,115 --> 00:57:41,054
This is from "Oklahoma".
Here's the lyrics right here.

937
00:57:41,054 --> 00:57:43,387
- "Surrey with the Fringe on Top."
- Yes, perfect.

938
00:58:17,399 --> 00:58:18,557
What?

939
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:22,123
It's my voice, isn't it?
You hate my voice.

940
00:58:22,363 --> 00:58:25,556
- I know, it's terrible. Joe hated my voice...
- It's Helen.

941
00:58:25,982 --> 00:58:27,078
Helen?

942
00:58:28,065 --> 00:58:29,909
She's coming
right towards me.

943
00:58:38,355 --> 00:58:42,776
- How are you, Harry?
- Fine. I'm fine.

944
00:58:43,696 --> 00:58:46,579
This is Ira Stone.
Harry Burns.

945
00:58:46,579 --> 00:58:47,843
Harry.

946
00:58:52,336 --> 00:58:57,442
I'm sorry. This is Sally Albright.
Helen Hillson... and Ira.

947
00:58:58,289 --> 00:58:59,680
Sally.

948
00:59:00,049 --> 00:59:02,540
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

949
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:07,215
Well...

950
00:59:08,063 --> 00:59:11,201
- See you.
- Yeah. Bye.

951
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:15,416
Nice to meet you... Ira.

952
00:59:20,441 --> 00:59:21,981
You okay?

953
00:59:23,757 --> 00:59:25,318
Yeah, I'm perfect.

954
00:59:26,385 --> 00:59:27,759
She looked weird,
didn't she?

955
00:59:27,759 --> 00:59:30,017
She looked really weird.
She looked very weird

956
00:59:30,017 --> 00:59:31,101
I've never seen her before.

957
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:33,655
Trust me. She looked weird.
Her legs looked heavy.

958
00:59:33,785 --> 00:59:35,816
- Really. She must be retaining water.
- Harry...

959
00:59:35,851 --> 00:59:38,995
Believe me,
the woman saved everything.

960
00:59:41,597 --> 00:59:43,151
Sure you're okay?

961
00:59:43,774 --> 00:59:47,113
Oh, I'm fine. Look,
it had to happen at some point.

962
00:59:47,113 --> 00:59:49,690
In a city of eight million people,
you're bound to run into your ex-wife.

963
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:52,152
So, boom, it happened.
And now I'm fine.

964
00:59:56,113 --> 00:59:59,203
I like it. It works.
It says "home" to me.

965
00:59:59,238 --> 01:00:02,525
All right. All right.
We'll let Harry and Sally be the judge.

966
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:05,179
What do you think?

967
01:00:06,294 --> 01:00:08,092
- It's nice.
- Case closed.

968
01:00:08,173 --> 01:00:12,050
Of course he likes it,
he's a guy. Sally?

969
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:15,833
What's so awful about it?

970
01:00:16,236 --> 01:00:20,447
It's so awful, there's no way to even begin
to explain what's so awful about it.

971
01:00:20,447 --> 01:00:22,943
Honey, I don't object
to any of your things.

972
01:00:22,943 --> 01:00:25,138
If we had an extra room,
you could put all your things in it,

973
01:00:25,138 --> 01:00:26,570
including your bar stools...

974
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:28,432
Honey, wait, wait, wait.
Honey, honey, wait, wait, wait.

975
01:00:28,432 --> 01:00:30,098
You don't like my bar stools?

976
01:00:31,113 --> 01:00:33,877
Harry, come on,
someone has to be on my side.

977
01:00:33,975 --> 01:00:36,886
I'm on your side. I'm just trying
to help you have good taste.

978
01:00:36,886 --> 01:00:38,814
I have good taste.

979
01:00:39,316 --> 01:00:42,191
Everybody thinks they have
good taste and a sense of humor,

980
01:00:42,191 --> 01:00:44,788
but they couldn't possibly
all have good taste.

981
01:00:44,788 --> 01:00:48,460
You know, it's funny.
We started out like this, Helen and I.

982
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:51,499
We had bank walls, we hung things,
we picked out tiles together.

983
01:00:51,874 --> 01:00:53,298
Then you know what happens?

984
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:55,102
Six years later
you find yourself singing

985
01:00:55,102 --> 01:00:57,868
"Surrey with the Fringe on Top"
in front of Ira!

986
01:00:58,615 --> 01:01:00,830
Do we have to talk
about this right now?

987
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:03,833
Yes. I think that right now actually is
the perfect time to talk about this,

988
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:07,526
because I want our friends to benefit
from the wisdom of my experience.

989
01:01:07,627 --> 01:01:09,368
Right now
everything is great.

990
01:01:09,403 --> 01:01:12,597
Everyone is happy, everone is in love,
and that's wonderful.

991
01:01:12,632 --> 01:01:14,556
But you gotta know
that sooner or later,

992
01:01:14,556 --> 01:01:17,986
you're gonna be screaming at each other
about who's gonna get this dish.

993
01:01:17,986 --> 01:01:21,301
This 8-dollar dish will cost you
1,000 dollar in phone calls

994
01:01:21,301 --> 01:01:23,274
to the legal firm of
"That's mine, this is yours".

995
01:01:23,274 --> 01:01:24,746
- Harry...
- Please.

996
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:27,952
Jess, Marie,
do me a favour for your own good.

997
01:01:28,793 --> 01:01:31,115
Put your name
in your books right now

998
01:01:31,115 --> 01:01:33,198
before they get mixed up and
you don't know whose is whose,

999
01:01:33,198 --> 01:01:34,936
because some day,
believe it or not,

1000
01:01:34,936 --> 01:01:38,362
you'll go 15 rounds over
who's gonna get this coffee table.

1001
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:43,712
This stupid, wagon-wheel,
Roy-Rogers, garage-sale coffee table!

1002
01:01:45,688 --> 01:01:49,657
- I thought you liked it.
- I was being nice!

1003
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,942
He just bumped into Helen.

1004
01:02:03,479 --> 01:02:04,760
I want you to know...

1005
01:02:06,398 --> 01:02:10,574
that I will never want
that wagon-wheel coffee table.

1006
01:02:19,377 --> 01:02:21,735
I know, I know,
I shouldn't have done it.

1007
01:02:22,651 --> 01:02:24,727
Harry, you're gonna have
to try and find a way

1008
01:02:24,727 --> 01:02:27,572
of not expressing
every feeling that you have,

1009
01:02:27,572 --> 01:02:29,424
every moment
that you have them.

1010
01:02:29,424 --> 01:02:32,092
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1011
01:02:32,271 --> 01:02:34,885
There are times
and places for things.

1012
01:02:35,875 --> 01:02:38,624
Well, the next time you're giving
a lecture series on social graces,

1013
01:02:38,624 --> 01:02:40,638
would you let know,
cause I'll sign up.

1014
01:02:41,009 --> 01:02:44,734
Hey! You don't have
to take your anger out on me.

1015
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:47,199
Oh, I think I'm entitled
to throw a little anger your way.

1016
01:02:47,234 --> 01:02:51,073
Especially when I'm being told how
to live my life by Miss Hospital Corners.

1017
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:55,122
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I mean, nothing bothers you!

1018
01:02:55,122 --> 01:02:58,535
- You never get upset about anything!
- Don't be ridiculous.

1019
01:02:58,779 --> 01:02:59,778
What?

1020
01:03:00,162 --> 01:03:03,560
You never get upset about Joe.
I never see that back up on you.

1021
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:04,723
How is that possible?

1022
01:03:04,723 --> 01:03:07,146
Don't you experience
any feelings of loss?

1023
01:03:07,281 --> 01:03:09,364
I don't have to take
this crap from you.

1024
01:03:09,364 --> 01:03:11,729
If you're so over Joe,
why aren't you seeing anyone?

1025
01:03:11,729 --> 01:03:13,075
I see people!

1026
01:03:13,075 --> 01:03:16,408
See people... Have you slept with
one person since you broke up with Joe?

1027
01:03:16,424 --> 01:03:19,129
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

1028
01:03:19,436 --> 01:03:22,782
That will prove I'm over Joe
because I fuck somebody?

1029
01:03:23,556 --> 01:03:25,474
Harry, you're gonna have
to move back to New Jersey

1030
01:03:25,474 --> 01:03:27,262
because you've slept
with everybody in New York

1031
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:30,611
and I don't see that turning Helen
into a faint memory for you.

1032
01:03:31,117 --> 01:03:34,408
Besides, I will make love
to somebody when it is making love.

1033
01:03:34,408 --> 01:03:37,802
Not the way you do it,
like you're out for revenge or something.

1034
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:42,875
- Are you finished now?
- Yes.

1035
01:03:43,388 --> 01:03:46,820
- Can I say something?
- Yes.

1036
01:03:50,073 --> 01:03:52,774
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1037
01:04:03,888 --> 01:04:05,471
Don't say a word.

1038
01:04:09,997 --> 01:04:12,833
It's a monkey, it's a monkey.
Monkey see, monkey do.

1039
01:04:13,075 --> 01:04:15,663
- It's... it's an ape. Going ape.
- It's a baby!

1040
01:04:16,546 --> 01:04:17,645
Planet of the Apes!

1041
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:19,099
Planet of the Apes?
She just said it's a baby!

1042
01:04:19,099 --> 01:04:20,133
How 'bout
Planet of the Dopes?

1043
01:04:20,133 --> 01:04:21,296
It doesn't look like a baby.

1044
01:04:21,296 --> 01:04:24,076
Bet up. Big mouth.
Mick Jagger is a baby!

1045
01:04:24,076 --> 01:04:26,559
- Baby ape! Baby ape!
- Stop with the apes, will you?

1046
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:29,522
- Uh, baby's breath.
- Baby... Rosemary's Baby's mouth?

1047
01:04:30,049 --> 01:04:32,759
- "Won't You Come Home, Bill Baby?"
- Baby, baby... Kiss the baby!

1048
01:04:32,759 --> 01:04:34,116
"Melancholy Baby's Mouth"!

1049
01:04:34,116 --> 01:04:36,722
Baby fish... Baby-fish mouth!
Baby-fish mouth!

1050
01:04:38,131 --> 01:04:40,060
- 15 seconds.
- A big baby mouth.

1051
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,316
- B-b-baby Boom!
- Baby...

1052
01:04:42,316 --> 01:04:44,635
Draw something
resembling anything!

1053
01:04:45,557 --> 01:04:48,662
- Crying baby. Kiss the baby.
- Baby spitting up... Exorcist Baby!

1054
01:04:49,505 --> 01:04:53,003
- Baby... "Yes, sir, that's my baby".
- "No, sir, don't mean maybe."

1055
01:04:53,038 --> 01:04:55,624
- That's it. Time's up.
- Baby talk.

1056
01:04:55,874 --> 01:04:59,354
Baby talk? Wh-wh-what's that?
That's not a saying.

1057
01:04:59,461 --> 01:05:02,937
Oh, but "baby-fish mouth" is sweeping
the nation. I hear them talking.

1058
01:05:03,455 --> 01:05:06,225
Final score. Our team: 110.

1059
01:05:06,225 --> 01:05:08,114
You guys: 60.

1060
01:05:08,284 --> 01:05:11,265
- Ouch. Fix. Definitely a fix.
- Pathetic.

1061
01:05:11,937 --> 01:05:16,378
- I can't draw.
- No, that's a baby, and it's clearly talking.

1062
01:05:17,104 --> 01:05:18,344
You're wonderful.

1063
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,931
- All right, who wants coffee?
- I do, and I love you.

1064
01:05:21,931 --> 01:05:24,372
- D'you have any tea?
- Industrial strength.

1065
01:05:25,155 --> 01:05:27,767
- I'll help you. Decaf?
- Yeah.

1066
01:05:29,208 --> 01:05:30,735
- Three.
- Yes, please.

1067
01:05:31,134 --> 01:05:33,903
- Where's the bathroom?
- Through that door, down the hall.

1068
01:05:41,588 --> 01:05:43,226
Never looked
like a baby to me.

1069
01:05:43,346 --> 01:05:44,951
- Which part?
- All of it.

1070
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:46,906
Hey, Jess, you were gonna show me
the cover of your new book.

1071
01:05:46,906 --> 01:05:48,685
Oh, yeah, yeah,
it's-it's in the den.

1072
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:49,953
Look, uh, Julian,
help yourself.

1073
01:05:49,953 --> 01:05:52,742
Have some, uh, more wine,
whatever you like, okay?

1074
01:05:53,054 --> 01:05:55,487
I like saying "it's in the den".
It's got a nice ring to it.

1075
01:05:55,732 --> 01:05:58,466
Emily's a little young for Harry,
don't you think?

1076
01:05:58,722 --> 01:06:01,106
Well, she's young,
but look what she's done.

1077
01:06:01,527 --> 01:06:03,957
What has she done?
She makes desserts.

1078
01:06:04,289 --> 01:06:06,232
Does Julian seem
a little stuffy to you?

1079
01:06:06,232 --> 01:06:08,883
He's a good guy.
You should talk to 'im. Get to know 'im.

1080
01:06:08,918 --> 01:06:10,136
He's too tall to talk to.

1081
01:06:10,185 --> 01:06:13,312
She makes 3,500
chocolate-mousse pies a week.

1082
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:16,841
Emily is "Aunt Emily"?

1083
01:06:16,985 --> 01:06:19,928
He took us all to a Met game
last week. It was great.

1084
01:06:19,963 --> 01:06:21,671
You all went
to a Met game together?

1085
01:06:21,671 --> 01:06:24,117
Yeah, but... but, yeah,
it was a last-minute thing.

1086
01:06:24,377 --> 01:06:25,742
But Sally hates baseball.

1087
01:06:25,742 --> 01:06:27,736
Harry doesn't even like sweets.

1088
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:33,137
- Julian is great.
- I know. He's a grown-up.

1089
01:06:33,137 --> 01:06:34,276
Emily is terrific.

1090
01:06:34,276 --> 01:06:36,835
Yeah. Of course,
when I asked her where she was

1091
01:06:36,835 --> 01:06:39,392
when Kennedy was shot,
she said "Ted Kennedy was shot?"

1092
01:06:39,392 --> 01:06:40,413
No...

1093
01:06:52,158 --> 01:06:54,194
- Hello?
- Are you alone?

1094
01:06:54,424 --> 01:06:56,158
Yeah.
I was just finishing a book.

1095
01:06:56,472 --> 01:06:59,324
<i>- Could you come over?
- What's the matter?</i>

1096
01:06:59,824 --> 01:07:02,417
- He's getting married.
- Who?

1097
01:07:03,277 --> 01:07:04,319
Joe!

1098
01:07:05,316 --> 01:07:06,795
I'll be right there.

1099
01:07:11,234 --> 01:07:13,897
- Hi.
- You all right?

1100
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:18,548
Come on in.

1101
01:07:21,734 --> 01:07:24,473
- I'm sorry to call you so late.
- It's all right.

1102
01:07:26,138 --> 01:07:28,418
- I need a Kleenex.
- Okay.

1103
01:07:28,635 --> 01:07:30,302
Okay. Okay.

1104
01:07:30,648 --> 01:07:33,218
He just called me up.
"Wanted to see how you were."

1105
01:07:33,365 --> 01:07:35,853
"Fine. How are you?"
"Fine."

1106
01:07:36,062 --> 01:07:38,997
His secretary's on vacation,
everything's all backed up.

1107
01:07:39,132 --> 01:07:43,413
He's got a big case in Newark...
blah, blah, blah.

1108
01:07:44,691 --> 01:07:49,153
And I'm sitting on the phone thinking
"I am over him, I really am over him,

1109
01:07:49,153 --> 01:07:52,511
I can't believe I was ever
remotely interested in any of this."

1110
01:07:54,286 --> 01:07:56,846
And then he said
"I have some news."

1111
01:08:01,307 --> 01:08:05,604
She works in his office. She's a paralegal.
Her name is Kimberly.

1112
01:08:07,526 --> 01:08:09,302
He just met her!

1113
01:08:09,629 --> 01:08:12,689
She's supposed to be
his transitional person,

1114
01:08:12,689 --> 01:08:15,374
she's not supposed
to be "the one"!

1115
01:08:20,694 --> 01:08:25,116
All this time, I've been saying...
that he didn't wanna get married.

1116
01:08:26,985 --> 01:08:31,329
But the truth is...
he didn't wanna marry me.

1117
01:08:35,171 --> 01:08:37,001
He didn't love me.

1118
01:08:41,349 --> 01:08:43,738
If you could take him back
right now, would you?

1119
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:47,403
No!

1120
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:50,856
But why didn't he
wanna marry me?

1121
01:08:51,489 --> 01:08:54,354
- What's the matter with me?
- Nothing.

1122
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:56,857
- I'm difficult.
- You're challenging.

1123
01:08:57,028 --> 01:09:00,060
I'm too structured.
I'm completely closed off.

1124
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:05,003
- But in a good way.
- No, no, no. I drove him away.

1125
01:09:07,354 --> 01:09:11,214
- And I'm gonna be 40!
- When?

1126
01:09:12,351 --> 01:09:14,853
- Some day.
- In eight years.

1127
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:20,287
But it's there! It's just sitting there
like this big dead end.

1128
01:09:21,464 --> 01:09:23,264
And it's not the same for men.

1129
01:09:23,867 --> 01:09:27,069
Charlie Chaplin had babies
when he was 73.

1130
01:09:27,069 --> 01:09:29,090
Yeah, but he was too old
to pick 'em up.

1131
01:09:35,523 --> 01:09:37,711
Ohh, come here.
Come here.

1132
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:42,169
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be fine, you'll see.

1133
01:09:43,506 --> 01:09:46,219
Go ahead. It's not one
of my favourites anyway.

1134
01:09:48,526 --> 01:09:51,114
It's gonna be okay. Hm?

1135
01:09:56,939 --> 01:10:00,039
Hm? Okay? Okay.

1136
01:10:04,013 --> 01:10:05,283
I'll make some tea.

1137
01:10:05,283 --> 01:10:08,080
Harry, could you just
hold me a little longer?

1138
01:10:07,209 --> 01:10:09,565
Oh, sure.

1139
01:10:16,156 --> 01:10:17,797
Okay? Hm?

1140
01:10:50,155 --> 01:10:52,851
- Are you comfortable?
- Sure.

1141
01:10:58,948 --> 01:11:01,189
D'you want something
to drink or something?

1142
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:03,040
No, I'm okay.

1143
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:07,564
I'm gonna get up for some water,
so it's really no trouble.

1144
01:11:08,053 --> 01:11:10,374
Okay. Water.

1145
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:09,173
You have all your video tapes
alphabetized and on index cards.

1146
01:12:10,524 --> 01:12:11,831
Thank you.

1147
01:12:12,176 --> 01:12:15,740
- D'you wanna watch something?
- No. Not unless you do.

1148
01:12:16,141 --> 01:12:18,370
No. That's okay.

1149
01:12:32,355 --> 01:12:36,066
- D'you wanna go to sleep?
- Okay.

1150
01:13:10,257 --> 01:13:14,481
- Where are you going?
- I gotta go.

1151
01:13:16,289 --> 01:13:18,031
Gotta go home,
I gotta change my clothes

1152
01:13:18,031 --> 01:13:19,873
and then I have to go to work.
And so do you.

1153
01:13:19,908 --> 01:13:23,185
But after work, I'd like to take you out
to dinner, if you're free. Are you free?

1154
01:13:23,636 --> 01:13:26,213
- Yes.
- Fine. I'll call you later.

1155
01:13:26,857 --> 01:13:29,380
- Fine.
- Fine.

1156
01:13:48,198 --> 01:13:50,536
- Yours.
- Hello.

1157
01:13:50,536 --> 01:13:52,911
- I'm sorry to call so early.
- Are you all right?

1158
01:13:52,911 --> 01:13:54,321
No one I know
would call at this hour.

1159
01:13:54,321 --> 01:13:56,578
- I did something terrible.
- What did you do?

1160
01:13:56,613 --> 01:13:58,560
- No one I know would call at this hour.
- It's so awful.

1161
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,102
- I need to talk.
- What happened?

1162
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:00,692
What's the matter?

1163
01:14:00,692 --> 01:14:02,925
- Harry came over last night.
- I went over to Sally's last night.

1164
01:14:02,925 --> 01:14:04,648
Because I was upset that
Joe was getting married.

1165
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:05,574
And one thing led to another.

1166
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:07,204
And before I knew,
we were kissing. And then...

1167
01:14:07,204 --> 01:14:08,248
To make a long story short...

1168
01:14:08,248 --> 01:14:08,956
- We did it.
- We did it.

1169
01:14:08,956 --> 01:14:10,069
They did it!

1170
01:14:10,142 --> 01:14:12,641
- That's great, Sally!
- We've been praying for it.

1171
01:14:12,641 --> 01:14:13,956
You should've done it
in the first place.

1172
01:14:13,956 --> 01:14:15,402
For months we've been saying
you should do it.

1173
01:14:14,532 --> 01:14:18,077
- You guys belong together.
- It's like killing two birds with one stone.

1174
01:14:18,097 --> 01:14:19,909
It's like two wrongs
make a right.

1175
01:14:19,909 --> 01:14:20,880
- How was it?
- How was it?

1176
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,592
- The durring part was good...
- The durring part was good...

1177
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:24,435
- ... but then I felt suffocated.
- ... then I guess it wasn't.

1178
01:14:24,435 --> 01:14:25,941
- Jesus, I'm sorry.
- The worst.

1179
01:14:25,941 --> 01:14:27,607
- I had to get outta there.
- He just disappeared.

1180
01:14:27,607 --> 01:14:29,345
- I feel so bad.
- I'm so embarrassed.

1181
01:14:29,345 --> 01:14:30,099
I don't blame you.

1182
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:31,340
- That's horrible.
- I think I'm coming down with something.

1183
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:32,687
I think I'm catching a cold.

1184
01:14:32,687 --> 01:14:34,891
Look, it would have been great
if it worked out, but it didn't.

1185
01:14:34,891 --> 01:14:36,410
I should never
go to bed with anyone

1186
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:38,381
when you found out
your ex-boyfriend is getting married.

1187
01:14:37,509 --> 01:14:39,382
- Who's that talking?
- Who?

1188
01:14:39,383 --> 01:14:40,383
Is that Jess on the phone?

1189
01:14:39,511 --> 01:14:42,658
- It's Jane Fonda on the VCR.
- It's Bryan Gumble.

1190
01:14:42,658 --> 01:14:44,364
D'you wanna
come over for breakfast?

1191
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:46,596
- No, I'm not up to it.
- No, I feel too awful.

1192
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:48,970
- Good.
- I-I mean, it's so early.

1193
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:51,657
- But call me later if you want.
- I'll call you later, okay?

1194
01:14:51,657 --> 01:14:52,854
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

1195
01:14:52,854 --> 01:14:54,276
- Bye.
- Bye.

1196
01:14:56,035 --> 01:14:58,825
- God!
- I know.

1197
01:14:59,908 --> 01:15:02,235
Tell me I'll never have
to be out there again.

1198
01:15:06,265 --> 01:15:08,789
You will never have
to be out there again.

1199
01:15:12,462 --> 01:15:14,375
<i>I'll just say
we made a mistake.</i>

1200
01:15:15,702 --> 01:15:18,616
<i>Sally... it was a mistake.</i>

1201
01:15:20,803 --> 01:15:23,213
<i>I just hope
I get to say it first.</i>

1202
01:15:24,206 --> 01:15:26,731
<i>I hope she says it
before I do.</i>

1203
01:15:29,805 --> 01:15:33,845
- It was a mistake.
- I am so relieved that you think so, too.

1204
01:15:35,354 --> 01:15:37,623
I'm not saying
last night wasn't great.

1205
01:15:38,171 --> 01:15:41,047
- It was.
- Yes, it was.

1206
01:15:42,358 --> 01:15:45,737
- We just never should have done it.
- I couldn't agree more.

1207
01:15:46,153 --> 01:15:49,394
- I'm so relieved.
- Great.

1208
01:15:49,536 --> 01:15:50,565
Yeah.

1209
01:15:54,019 --> 01:15:55,512
Two mixed green salads.

1210
01:16:25,455 --> 01:16:29,835
It is so nice when you can sit
with someone and not have to talk. Hmm?

1211
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:36,346
It's just like, most of the time,
you go to bed with someone,

1212
01:16:36,883 --> 01:16:40,188
then she tells you all her stories,
you tell her your stories...

1213
01:16:41,379 --> 01:16:44,494
But with Sally and me,
we'd already heard each other's stories.

1214
01:16:45,074 --> 01:16:47,947
So once we went to bed, we didn't know
what we were supposed to do.

1215
01:16:47,947 --> 01:16:50,453
- You know?
- Sure, Harry.

1216
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:53,384
I don't know.

1217
01:16:53,813 --> 01:16:55,721
Maybe you get to a certain point
in a relationship

1218
01:16:55,721 --> 01:16:58,868
where it's just too late
to have sex. You know?

1219
01:17:09,244 --> 01:17:11,241
Is Harry bringing anyone
to the wedding?

1220
01:17:11,824 --> 01:17:13,338
I don't think so.

1221
01:17:15,051 --> 01:17:20,518
- Is he seeing anyone?
- He was seeing this anthropologist, but...

1222
01:17:21,514 --> 01:17:25,638
- What does she look like?
- Thin, pretty, big tits.

1223
01:17:25,926 --> 01:17:27,793
Your basic nightmare.

1224
01:17:32,145 --> 01:17:33,808
What d'you think?

1225
01:17:35,569 --> 01:17:37,316
Oh, Marie...

1226
01:17:38,467 --> 01:17:44,096
- Tell the truth.
- It's just beautiful.

1227
01:18:15,789 --> 01:18:21,525
We are gathered here today to celebrate
the marriage of Marie... and Jess.

1228
01:18:22,338 --> 01:18:25,406
And to consecrate
their vows of matrimony.

1229
01:18:25,663 --> 01:18:29,027
The vows they will take
join their lives.

1230
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:34,512
The wine they will share
binds all their hopes together.

1231
01:18:34,652 --> 01:18:36,654
And by the rings
they will wear,

1232
01:18:36,915 --> 01:18:41,710
they will be known to all
as husband and wife.

1233
01:18:52,352 --> 01:18:56,327
I've never seen her so happy.
She's a totally different person.

1234
01:18:56,327 --> 01:19:00,494
Oh, yeah, she is. It's great,
but what're we gonna do about you?

1235
01:19:01,077 --> 01:19:01,865
- Me?
- Hon!

1236
01:19:01,865 --> 01:19:03,115
- Yeah.
- Wanna dance?

1237
01:19:03,347 --> 01:19:06,129
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I do.
- Excuse us.

1238
01:19:09,475 --> 01:19:11,782
- Hi.
- Hello.

1239
01:19:15,832 --> 01:19:18,821
- Nice ceremony.
- Beautiful.

1240
01:19:21,537 --> 01:19:24,208
Boy, the holidays are rough.
Every year I just try to get

1241
01:19:24,208 --> 01:19:26,906
from the day before Thanksgiving
to the day after New Year's.

1242
01:19:26,941 --> 01:19:28,835
A lot of suicides.

1243
01:19:30,306 --> 01:19:33,450
- Would you like a pea pod with shrimp?
- Thank you.

1244
01:19:34,844 --> 01:19:36,736
- How've you been?
- Fine.

1245
01:19:37,662 --> 01:19:39,615
- Are you seeing anybody?
- Harry.

1246
01:19:39,615 --> 01:19:41,499
- What?
- I don't wanna talk about this.

1247
01:19:41,499 --> 01:19:44,792
- Why not?
- I don't want to talk about it.

1248
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,938
Why can't we get past this?
I mean, are we gonna

1249
01:19:47,938 --> 01:19:49,551
carry this thing around forever?

1250
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:53,623
- Forever? It just happened!
- It happened three weeks ago.

1251
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:57,649
You know how a year to a person
is like seven years to a dog?

1252
01:19:58,299 --> 01:19:59,173
Yes.

1253
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:05,502
Is one of us supposed
to be a dog in this scenario?

1254
01:20:05,609 --> 01:20:08,062
- Yes.
- Who is the dog?

1255
01:20:08,215 --> 01:20:11,383
- You are.
- I am. I am the dog!

1256
01:20:11,383 --> 01:20:13,648
- Mmm-hmm.
- I am the dog! I...

1257
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:23,084
I don't see that, Harry.
If anybody is the dog, you are the dog.

1258
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:25,401
You wanna act like what happened
didn't mean anything.

1259
01:20:24,537 --> 01:20:26,812
I'm not saying
it didn't mean anything,

1260
01:20:26,812 --> 01:20:28,594
I'm saying why does it
have to mean everything?

1261
01:20:28,594 --> 01:20:31,039
Because it does!
And you should know that

1262
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:32,969
better than anybody,
because the minute that it happens

1263
01:20:32,969 --> 01:20:34,128
you walk right out the door!

1264
01:20:34,128 --> 01:20:37,075
- I didn't walk out.
- No, sprinted is more like it.

1265
01:20:37,202 --> 01:20:40,313
- We both agreed it was a mistake.
- The worst mistake I ever made!

1266
01:20:42,382 --> 01:20:44,800
- What do you want from me?
- I don't want anything from you.

1267
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,821
Fine. Fine. But let's
just get one thing straight.

1268
01:20:46,821 --> 01:20:49,053
I did not go over there that night
to make love to you.

1269
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:50,527
That is not why I went there.

1270
01:20:50,527 --> 01:20:52,467
But you looked up at me
with these big weepy eyes.

1271
01:20:52,467 --> 01:20:54,840
"Don't go home tonight, Harry.
Hold me a little longer, Harry."

1272
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,085
What was I supposed to do?

1273
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:58,899
What are you saying?
You took pity on me?

1274
01:20:58,899 --> 01:21:00,853
- No. I was...
- Fuck you!

1275
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,918
Everybody, could I... have
your attention, please?

1276
01:21:08,052 --> 01:21:12,227
I'd like to propose a toast.
To Harry and Sally.

1277
01:21:12,702 --> 01:21:14,130
To Harry and Sally.

1278
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:18,442
If Marie or I had found
either of them remotely attractive,

1279
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:21,239
we would not be here today.

1280
01:22:08,996 --> 01:22:11,620
Hi, it's me.
It's the holiday season,

1281
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:12,715
and I thought I'd remind you

1282
01:22:12,715 --> 01:22:15,430
that this is the season
of charity and forgiveness.

1283
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:19,858
<i>And, although it's not widely known,
it is also the season of grovelling.</i>

1284
01:22:20,243 --> 01:22:22,212
<i>So, if you felt
like calling me back,</i>

1285
01:22:22,724 --> 01:22:26,719
<i>I'd be more than happy to do
the traditional Christmas grovelling.</i>

1286
01:22:26,891 --> 01:22:28,325
<i>Give me a call.</i>

1287
01:22:44,921 --> 01:22:47,234
<i>Hi, I'm not home right now.
I'll call you right back.</i>

1288
01:22:47,811 --> 01:22:51,035
<i>If you're there, please pick up
the phone. I really wanna talk to you.</i>

1289
01:22:54,514 --> 01:22:56,751
The fact that you're not answering
leads me to believe

1290
01:22:56,751 --> 01:23:01,603
you're either, A: not at home,
B: home, but don't wanna talk to me,

1291
01:23:01,906 --> 01:23:04,674
<i>or C: home, desperately
wanna talk to me,</i>

1292
01:23:04,674 --> 01:23:07,113
<i>but trapped
under something heavy.</i>

1293
01:23:07,414 --> 01:23:10,141
<i>If it's either A or C,
please call me back.</i>

1294
01:23:12,830 --> 01:23:14,454
Obviously she doesn't
wanna talk to me.

1295
01:23:14,454 --> 01:23:16,567
What do I have to do,
be hit over the head?

1296
01:23:16,923 --> 01:23:18,630
If she wants to call me,
she'll call me.

1297
01:23:19,063 --> 01:23:20,713
I'm through making
a schmuck out of myself.

1298
01:23:21,406 --> 01:23:24,394
If you're feeling
sad and lonely

1299
01:23:24,394 --> 01:23:28,214
There's a service
I can render

1300
01:23:28,214 --> 01:23:30,977
<i>Tell the one
who digs you only</i>

1301
01:23:31,396 --> 01:23:34,408
<i>I can be
so warm and tender</i>

1302
01:23:34,783 --> 01:23:36,048
<i>Call me.</i>

1303
01:23:36,355 --> 01:23:39,713
<i>Maybe it's late
to just call me</i>

1304
01:23:40,174 --> 01:23:43,681
Don't be afraid
to just phone moi

1305
01:23:43,681 --> 01:23:47,767
<i>Call me
and I'll be around</i>

1306
01:23:47,767 --> 01:23:49,098
Give me a call.

1307
01:23:49,293 --> 01:23:51,857
- Hi, Harry.
- Hello. Hi! Hi!

1308
01:23:51,965 --> 01:23:54,561
I di... I didn't know that you would...
That you were there.

1309
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:57,641
<i>- What're you doing?
- I was just on my way out.</i>

1310
01:23:57,641 --> 01:23:58,878
<i>Where you going?</i>

1311
01:24:00,416 --> 01:24:03,202
- What d'you want, Harry?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1312
01:24:03,202 --> 01:24:06,582
I... I... just called
to say I'm sorry.

1313
01:24:08,412 --> 01:24:09,791
Okay.

1314
01:24:17,229 --> 01:24:20,066
- I gotta go.
- Wait a second. Wait... wait a second.

1315
01:24:20,997 --> 01:24:23,788
What're you doin' for New Year's?
Are you going to the Tylers' party?

1316
01:24:23,788 --> 01:24:25,298
Cause I don't have a date.

1317
01:24:25,492 --> 01:24:26,444
And if you don't have a date,

1318
01:24:26,444 --> 01:24:28,742
we always said that if
neither one of us had a date,

1319
01:24:28,742 --> 01:24:31,627
<i>we could be together
for New Year's and kick in, you know...</i>

1320
01:24:31,627 --> 01:24:35,227
I can't do this any more.
I am not your consolation prize.

1321
01:24:35,499 --> 01:24:36,954
Goodbye.

1322
01:24:46,438 --> 01:24:48,543
<i>And here we are
once again.</i>

1323
01:24:48,543 --> 01:24:53,622
<i>The 16th annual "New Year's
Rockin' Eve", coming to you live...</i>

1324
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:57,627
<i>What's so bad about this?
You got Dick Clark. That's tradition.</i>

1325
01:24:57,627 --> 01:25:00,206
<i>You got Mallomars,
the greatest cookie of all time.</i>

1326
01:25:00,241 --> 01:25:04,746
<i>And you're about to give the Knicks
their first championship since 1973.</i>

1327
01:25:22,845 --> 01:25:24,947
I don't know why I let you
drag me to this.

1328
01:25:29,549 --> 01:25:33,794
<i>This is much better. Fresh air,
I've the streets all to myself.</i>

1329
01:25:34,377 --> 01:25:36,412
<i>Who needs to be
at a big, crowded party,</i>

1330
01:25:36,412 --> 01:25:38,106
<i>pretending
to have a good time?</i>

1331
01:25:38,388 --> 01:25:41,521
<i>Plus, this is the perfect time
to catch up on my window-shopping.</i>

1332
01:25:42,404 --> 01:25:43,493
<i>This is good.</i>

1333
01:25:55,689 --> 01:25:58,672
So the guy says...
"Read the card."

1334
01:26:08,856 --> 01:26:11,444
- I'm going home.
- You'll never get a taxi.

1335
01:26:13,006 --> 01:26:14,439
Oh, God!

1336
01:26:41,886 --> 01:26:44,186
<i>You realize, of course, that
we could never be friends.</i>

1337
01:26:44,603 --> 01:26:46,697
<i>- Why not?
- What I'm saying</i>

1338
01:26:46,697 --> 01:26:48,782
<i> is that men and women
can't be friends,</i>

1339
01:26:48,782 --> 01:26:51,124
<i>because the sex part
always gets in the way.</i>

1340
01:26:51,124 --> 01:26:52,198
<i>That's not true!</i>

1341
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:55,047
<i>No man can be friends
with a woman he finds attractive.</i>

1342
01:26:55,047 --> 01:26:56,812
<i>He always wants
to have sex with her.</i>

1343
01:26:57,054 --> 01:26:59,268
<i>What if they don't wanna
have sex with you?</i>

1344
01:26:58,393 --> 01:27:01,678
<i>Doesn't matter. Because
the sex thing is already out there,</i>

1345
01:27:01,678 --> 01:27:03,151
<i>so the friendship
is ultimately doomed.</i>

1346
01:27:03,151 --> 01:27:05,205
<i>And that is
the end of the story.</i>

1347
01:27:05,853 --> 01:27:07,783
<i>Well, I guess
we're not gonna be friends then.</i>

1348
01:27:07,783 --> 01:27:09,912
<i>- Guess not.
- That's too bad.</i>

1349
01:27:10,489 --> 01:27:12,847
<i>You were the only person
that I knew in New York.</i>

1350
01:28:00,389 --> 01:28:03,262
- I'm going.
- It's almost midnight.

1351
01:28:03,994 --> 01:28:06,561
The thought of
not kissing somebody is just...

1352
01:28:06,562 --> 01:28:07,961
I'll kiss you.

1353
01:28:08,595 --> 01:28:10,714
Hey, taxi! Taxi!

1354
01:28:11,396 --> 01:28:12,375
Taxi!

1355
01:28:13,473 --> 01:28:14,586
Shit.

1356
01:28:16,164 --> 01:28:20,366
- Come on, stay. Please.
- Thanks, Jess. I just... I have to go.

1357
01:28:20,667 --> 01:28:23,264
- Oh, wait two minutes.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

1358
01:29:03,405 --> 01:29:06,431
I've been doin' a lot of thinkin',
and the thing is... I love you.

1359
01:29:07,485 --> 01:29:09,800
- What?
- I love you.

1360
01:29:10,566 --> 01:29:12,946
How d'you expect me
to respond to this?

1361
01:29:13,145 --> 01:29:15,145
How 'bout
you love me, too?

1362
01:29:15,435 --> 01:29:17,170
How 'bout I'm leaving?

1363
01:29:17,170 --> 01:29:19,338
Doesn't what I said
mean anything to you?

1364
01:29:19,554 --> 01:29:22,378
I'm sorry, Harry.
I know it's New Year's Eve,

1365
01:29:22,378 --> 01:29:23,753
I know you're feeling lonely,

1366
01:29:23,753 --> 01:29:26,518
but you just can't show up here,
tell me you love me

1367
01:29:26,518 --> 01:29:28,604
and expect that
to make everything all right.

1368
01:29:29,058 --> 01:29:32,133
- It doesn't work this way.
- Well, how does it work?

1369
01:29:32,569 --> 01:29:36,170
- I don't know, but not this way.
- How 'bout this way?

1370
01:29:36,618 --> 01:29:39,479
I love that you get cold
when it's 71 degrees out.

1371
01:29:39,514 --> 01:29:42,333
I love that it takes you an hour
and a half to order a sandwich.

1372
01:29:42,368 --> 01:29:44,224
I love that you get
a little crinkle above your nose

1373
01:29:44,224 --> 01:29:45,643
when you're looking at me
like I'm nuts.

1374
01:29:44,776 --> 01:29:47,534
I love that after
I spend a day with you,

1375
01:29:47,534 --> 01:29:49,618
I can still smell
your perfume on my clothes.

1376
01:29:49,618 --> 01:29:51,942
And I love that
you are the last person

1377
01:29:51,942 --> 01:29:54,172
I wanna talk to
before I go to sleep at night.

1378
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:58,151
And it's not because I'm lonely,
and it's not because it's New Year's Eve.

1379
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:00,480
I came here tonight because,
when you realize

1380
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,688
you wanna spend
the rest of your life with somebody,

1381
01:30:02,723 --> 01:30:05,719
you want the rest of your life
to start as soon as possible.

1382
01:30:09,548 --> 01:30:10,543
You see?

1383
01:30:12,266 --> 01:30:14,442
That is just like you, Harry.

1384
01:30:14,442 --> 01:30:18,798
You say things like that and you make it
impossible for me to hate you!

1385
01:30:19,969 --> 01:30:21,966
And I hate you, Harry.

1386
01:30:23,861 --> 01:30:25,736
I really hate you.

1387
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:31,506
I hate you.

1388
01:30:49,309 --> 01:30:52,871
What does this song mean? My whole life,
I don't know what this song means.

1389
01:30:52,993 --> 01:30:54,556
I mean "Should auld acquaintance
be forgot",

1390
01:30:54,556 --> 01:30:56,607
does that mean that we
should forget old acquaintance?

1391
01:30:56,607 --> 01:30:58,307
Or does it mean that
we haven't to forget them,

1392
01:30:58,307 --> 01:30:59,066
we should remember them?

1393
01:30:59,066 --> 01:31:01,070
Which is not possible
because we already forgot 'em.

1394
01:31:01,704 --> 01:31:04,394
Well, maybe it just means
that... we should remember

1395
01:31:04,394 --> 01:31:06,406
that we forgot them,
or something.

1396
01:31:08,799 --> 01:31:11,086
Anyway,
it's about old friends.

1397
01:31:18,888 --> 01:31:21,063
<i>The first time we met
we hated each other.</i>

1398
01:31:21,334 --> 01:31:23,794
<i>No, you didn't hate me.
I hated you.</i>

1399
01:31:24,011 --> 01:31:26,222
<i>The second time we met,
you didn't even remember me.</i>

1400
01:31:25,357 --> 01:31:28,206
<i>I did, too!
I remembered you.</i>

1401
01:31:28,711 --> 01:31:31,304
<i>The third time we met,
we became friends.</i>

1402
01:31:31,511 --> 01:31:34,567
<i>- We were friends for a long time.
- And then we weren't.</i>

1403
01:31:35,002 --> 01:31:36,980
<i>And then we fell in love.</i>

1404
01:31:37,772 --> 01:31:40,876
- Three months later we got married.
- It only took three months.

1405
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:43,058
Twelve years
and three months.

1406
01:31:43,378 --> 01:31:45,549
We had this really really
wonderful wedding.

1407
01:31:45,549 --> 01:31:47,169
It was... it really was a...

1408
01:31:47,169 --> 01:31:47,901
- ... a beautiful wedding.
- It was great.

1409
01:31:47,901 --> 01:31:50,177
We had
this enormous... coconut cake.

1410
01:31:50,177 --> 01:31:52,654
Huge coconut cake
with the... with the tiers

1411
01:31:52,654 --> 01:31:55,544
and there was this-thid very rich
chocolate sauce on the side...

1412
01:31:55,738 --> 01:31:59,350
Right. Cause not everybody likes it
on the cake cause it makes it very soggy.

1413
01:31:59,350 --> 01:32:01,361
Particularly,
the coconut soaks up a lot,

1414
01:32:01,361 --> 01:32:03,625
so you really... it's important
to keep it on the side.

1415
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:04,009
Right.
